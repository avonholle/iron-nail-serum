  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transferrin saturation is widely considered the preferred screening test for hemochromatosis. Unsaturated iron-binding capacity has similar performance at lower cost. However, the withinperson biological variability of both these tests may limit their ability at commonly used cut points to detect HFE C282Y homozygous patients. METHODS: The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study screened 101,168 primary care participants for iron overload using transferrin saturation, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and HFE C282Y and H63D genotyping. Transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity were performed at initial screening and again when selected participants and controls returned for a clinical examination several months later. A missed case was defined as a C282Y homozygote who had transferrin saturation below the cut point (45\% for women, 50\% for men) or unsaturated iron-binding capacity above the cut point (150 ␮mol/L for women, 125 ␮mol/L for men) at the initial screening or the clinical examination, or both, regardless of serum ferritin. RESULTS: There were 209 C282Y previously undiagnosed homozygotes with transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity testing performed at the initial screening and clinical examination. Sixty-eight C282Y homozygotes (33\%) would have been missed at these transferrin saturation cut points (19 men, 49 women; median serum ferritin level of 170 ␮g/L; first and third quartiles, 50 and 474 ␮g/L), and 58 homozygotes (28\%) would have been missed at the unsaturated iron-binding capacity cut points (20 men, 38 women; median serum ferritin level of 168 ␮g/L; first and third quartiles, 38 and 454 ␮g/L). There was no advantage to using fasting samples. CONCLUSIONS: The within-person biological variability of transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity limits their usefulness as an initial screening test for expressing C282Y homozygotes. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Background: Cancer risk is associated with serum iron levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether haematological parameters reflect serum iron levels and may also be associated with cancer risk. Methods: We studied 1564 men and 1769 women who were enrolled in the Busselton Health Study, Western Australia. Haematological parameters evaluated included haemoglobin (Hb), mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) and mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and red cell distribution width (RCDW). Statistical analyses included t-tests for quantitative variables, chi-square tests for categorical variables and Cox proportional hazards regression modelling for cancer incidence and death. Results: There was marginal evidence of an association between MCV (as a continuous variable) and non-skin cancer incidence in women (HR 1.15, 95\% CI 1.013, 1.302; p = 0.030) but the hazard ratio was attenuated to nonsignificance after adjustment for serum ferritin (SF), iron and transferrin saturation (TS) (HR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.972, 1.264; p = 0.126). There was strong evidence of an association between MCHC and prostate cancer incidence in men; the estimated hazard ratio for an increase of one SD (0.5) in MCHC was 1.27 (95\% CI 1.064, 1.507; p = 0.008). These results remained significant after further adjustment for SF and iron; the estimated hazard ratio for an increase of one SD (0.5) in MCHC was 1.25 (p = 0.014, 95\% CI 1.05 to 1.48). Conclusions: The MCHC and MCV were associated with cancer incidence in a Western Australian population, although only MCHC remained associated with prostate cancer after adjusting with serum iron and TS (circulating iron) and SF (storage iron). Haematological parameters are thus of limited utility in population profiling for future cancer risk.},

  abstract = {Background: Statins treat hyperlipidemia and prevent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that they also have anti-neoplastic activity. Several studies show a reduced rate of breast cancer recurrence among lipophilic statin users (e.g., simvastatin), motivating calls for clinical trials of statins in breast cancer patients. We measured the impact of genetic variation in statin-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters on the recurrence rate in simvastatin-treated breast cancer patients. Methods: We conducted a nested case-control study among Danish women diagnosed with nonmetastatic, invasive breast cancer between 2004–2010 who had filled !1 prescription for simvastatin after diagnosis. Cases were all breast cancer recurrences from the source population; one control was matched to each case on cancer stage, estrogen receptor and hormone therapy status, calendar period of diagnosis, and duration of simvastatin exposure. We genotyped variants in simvastatinmetabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4/rs35599367 and CYP3A5/rs776746) and drug transporters (ABCB1/ rs2032582 and SLCO1B1/rs4149056), and estimated their association with recurrence with logistic regression models. Results: We observed protective (though imprecisely-measured) associations between variants in genes encoding drug transporters (ABCB1 and SLCO1B1) and simvastatin-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) and breast cancer recurrence in simvastatin-treated women. For example, carrying two variant alleles in ABCB1 was associated with a 31\% lower rate of recurrence (multivariable OR ¼ 0.69, 95\% CI: 0.31, 1.5). Conclusion: Our study provides weak evidence to support the use of genetic variation in ABCB1, SLCO1B1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 as biomarkers of breast tumor response to simvastatin. Validation of these findings within adjuvant clinical trials is encouraged.},

Venous blood was collected on 4 nonconsecutive days during a 2-wk period. Analytical (σ2rep) and biological (σ2fd) variance components were computed based on a previously established scheme in younger adults. These two variance components were summed to obtain the total day-today variability (σ2fd). Our results indicate that biological variation contributed most to the intraindividual variation. We calculated that sampling once for most iron indexes and twice for plasma transferrin receptors in elderly individuals is adequate to accurately determine these indexes whereas serum iron and transferrin saturation, indexes with high CVfd, require seven and eight measurements, respectively. These data, compared with previously published data in younger adults, demonstrate that aging is associated with a decreased variation in some indexes of iron status such as serum ferritin.},

  abstract = {The liver is an important site for iron and lipid metabolism and the main site for the interactions between these two metabolic pathways. Although conflicting results have been obtained, most studies support the hypothesis that iron plays a role in hepatic lipogenesis. Iron is an integral part of some enzymes and transporters involved in lipid metabolism and, as such, may exert a direct effect on hepatic lipid load, intrahepatic metabolic pathways and hepatic lipid secretion. On the other hand, iron in its ferrous form may indirectly affect lipid metabolism through its ability to induce oxidative stress and inflammation, a hypothesis which is currently the focus of much research in the field of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH). The present review will first discuss how iron might directly interact with the metabolism of hepatic lipids and then consider a new perspective on the way in which iron may have a role in the two hit hypothesis for the progression of NAFLD via ferroportin and the iron regulatory molecule hepcidin. The review concludes that iron has important interactions with lipid metabolism in the liver that can impact on the development of NAFLD/NASH. More defined studies are required to improve our understanding of these effects. (c) 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Much research has shown that iron store parameters are increased in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but an exact explanation for this phenomenon remains unavailable. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between iron status parameters and hormonal disturbances in women with PCOS that accounts for their increased iron store levels. Iron status parameters and hormones were measured using colorimetric and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, respectively. The results demonstrated a mild iron overload in the patients with PCOS. Good positive correlations between iron status parameters and serum testosterone, prolactin, and insulin were detected in the patient group, whereas iron status parameters and BMI were not significantly correlated. The data also suggest that the increase in serum ferritin and body iron store levels in patients with PCOS are associated with hyperandrogenemia, hyperprolactinemia, and hyperinsulinemia. The findings of this study expand current knowledge on the factors affecting iron stores and suggest a different mechanism of interaction between iron stores and the endocrine system through the harmful deposition of iron in endocrine glands and through hormonal effects on iron absorption and metabolism.},

  abstract = {Background Epidemiological studies indicate that aspirin consumption reduces the risk of tumors, which is especially relevant for colonic adenoma and carcinoma. Similar observations were made for glial brain tumors and breast cancers, yet the results are inconsistent. Gentisic acid (GA) is a minor catabolite of aspirin; yet humans carrying CYP2C9-variants incapable to catabolize aspirin to GA do not benefit from aspirin in prevention against colonic adenoma. GA blocks binding of Fibroblastic Growth Factor to its receptor and its sulphonate metabolite dobesilic acid blocks growth of C6 glioblastoma in vivo. GA is also an endogenously produced siderophore in mammalians for the transport of iron, a trace element which stimulates tumor growth and enhances anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Materials and Methods In this study, we assessed whether GA exerts direct antitumor activity on C6 glioma cells in vitro (cytotoxicity, colony growth, 3H-thymidine labeling analysis of DNA synthesis); and whether it can modify growth of Ehrlich breast ascites carcinoma (EAC) and solid tumors (EST) in vivo. GA and antitumoral trace element selenium block 12-lipoxygenase activity and aspirin's paradoxical inflammatory effects are seen in selenium-deficient humans; thus, we also investigated antitumor interactions between GA and sodium selenite. Lastly, we evaluated whether GA could protect against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity due to its function to chelate iron. Results Clinically achievable doses of GA blocked growth, colony formation and DNA synthesis of C6 glioma in vitro with high significance. GA enhanced the survival of EAC-bearing mice at a dosage of 0.4 mg/mice/day, in which 33\% of the treated animals survived more than 3-weeks, when all untreated mice succumbed to their tumors. Selenium decreased EST volumes initially, yet increased tumor volumes at later stages in surviving mice. GA alone reduced solid tumor growth and did not modify selenite antineoplasticity initially, but blocked the late tumor-stimulating effects of selenite. Lastly, doxorubicin-induced cardiac myofibrillary and endothelial damage and hyalinization necrosis were attenuated with GA treatment. Conclusions GA highly merits to be studied in further animal models as an anticancer and chemoprotective drug.},

  abstract = {Background Epidemiological studies indicate that aspirin consumption reduces the risk of tumors, which is especially relevant for colonic adenoma and carcinoma. Similar observations were made for glial brain tumors and breast cancers, yet the results are inconsistent. Gentisic acid (GA) is a minor catabolite of aspirin; yet humans carrying CYP2C9-variants incapable to catabolize aspirin to GA do not benefit from aspirin in prevention against colonic adenoma. GA blocks binding of Fibroblastic Growth Factor to its receptor and its sulphonate metabolite dobesilic acid blocks growth of C6 glioblastoma in vivo. GA is also an endogenously produced siderophore in mammalians for the transport of iron, a trace element which stimulates tumor growth and enhances anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Materials and Methods In this study, we assessed whether GA exerts direct antitumor activity on C6 glioma cells in vitro (cytotoxicity, colony growth, 3H-thymidine labeling analysis of DNA synthesis); and whether it can modify growth of Ehrlich breast ascites carcinoma (EAC) and solid tumors (EST) in vivo. GA and antitumoral trace element selenium block 12-lipoxygenase activity and aspirin's paradoxical inflammatory effects are seen in selenium-deficient humans; thus, we also investigated antitumor interactions between GA and sodium selenite. Lastly, we evaluated whether GA could protect against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity due to its function to chelate iron. Results Clinically achievable doses of GA blocked growth, colony formation and DNA synthesis of C6 glioma in vitro with high significance. GA enhanced the survival of EAC-bearing mice at a dosage of 0.4 mg/mice/day, in which 33\% of the treated animals survived more than 3-weeks, when all untreated mice succumbed to their tumors. Selenium decreased EST volumes initially, yet increased tumor volumes at later stages in surviving mice. GA alone reduced solid tumor growth and did not modify selenite antineoplasticity initially, but blocked the late tumor-stimulating effects of selenite. Lastly, doxorubicin-induced cardiac myofibrillary and endothelial damage and hyalinization necrosis were attenuated with GA treatment. Conclusions GA highly merits to be studied in further animal models as an anticancer and chemoprotective drug.},

We studied the associations in UK Biobank~and then included the results in a meta-analysis of published cohort studies. Methods UK Biobank, a general population cohort study, recruited participants aged 40–69 years. Incident breast cancer was ascertained via linkage to routine hospital admission, cancer registry and death certificate data. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore the associations between red and processed meat consumption and breast cancer. Previously published cohort studies were identified from a systematic review using PubMed and Ovid~and a meta-analysis conducted using a random effects model. Results Over a median of 7 years follow-up, 4819 of the 262,195 women developed breast cancer. The risk was increased in the highest tertile ({$>$}9~g/day) of processed meat consumption (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–1.35, p~=~0.001). Collation with 10 previous cohort studies provided data on 40,257 incident breast cancers in 1.65 million women. On meta-analysis, processed meat consumption was associated with overall (relative risk [RR] 1.06, 95\% CI 1.01–1.11) and post-menopausal (RR 1.09, 95\% CI 1.03–1.15), but not pre-menopausal (RR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.88–1.10), breast cancer. In UK Biobank and the meta-analysis, red meat consumption was not associated with breast cancer (adjusted HR 0.99 95\% CI 0.88–1.12 and RR 1.03, 95\% CI 0.99–1.08, respectively). Conclusions Consumption of processed meat, but not red meat, may increase the risk of breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Purpose Iron is essential for oxygen transport and oxidative metabolism; however, elevated iron stores can trigger overproduction of reactive oxygen species and induce DNA damage. Little is known about the association between body iron stores and glioma risk. This study examined associations of iron levels measured in toenails and genetic variants linked to body iron stores with risk of glioma in a clinic-based case-control study. Methods Samples were collected a median of 24 days following glioma diagnosis in the cases (10th-90th percentile range: 10-44 days). Nail iron levels were measured in 300 cases and 300 controls using neutron-activation analysis. A total of 24 genetic variants associated with iron status were genotyped in 622 cases and 628 controls. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for glioma risk according to toenail iron and the examined genotypes. Results No association was observed between toenail iron and glioma risk when restricting to cases with nails collected within \textasciitilde 3 weeks of diagnosis (OR=0.93; 95\% CI: 0.46, 1.87 comparing those with high (≥ 14 μg/g) versus low ({$<$}6 μg/g) iron levels). In contrast, an inverse association with increasing iron was observed after restricting to cases with a delay of 3 weeks or greater (OR=0.42; 95\% CI: 0.19, 0.95) reflecting potentially insidious effects of advancing disease on iron levels among the cases. No associations were observed for any of the examined genetic variants. Conclusion The results do not support a role for body iron stores as a determinant of glioma risk.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models provide individualized outcome predictions to inform patient counseling and clinical decision making. External validation is the process of examining a prediction model's performance in data independent to that used for model development. Current external validation studies often suffer from small sample sizes, and subsequently imprecise estimates of a model's predictive performance. To address this, we propose how to determine the minimum sample size needed for external validation of a clinical prediction model with a continuous outcome. Four criteria are proposed, that target precise estimates of (i) R2 (the proportion of variance explained), (ii) calibration-in-the-large (agreement between predicted and observed outcome values on average), (iii) calibration slope (agreement between predicted and observed values across the range of predicted values), and (iv) the variance of observed outcome values. Closed-form sample size solutions are derived for each criterion, which require the user to specify anticipated values of the model's performance (in particular R2) and the outcome variance in the external validation dataset. A sensible starting point is to base values on those for the model development study, as obtained from the publication or study authors. The largest sample size required to meet all four criteria is the recommended minimum sample size needed in the external validation dataset. The calculations can also be applied to estimate expected precision when an existing dataset with a fixed sample size is available, to help gauge if it is adequate. We illustrate the proposed methods on a case-study predicting fat-free mass in children.},

  abstract = {Withdrawal of iron from serum (hypoferraemia) is a conserved innate immune antimicrobial strategy that can withhold this critical nutrient from invading pathogens, impairing their growth. Hepcidin (Hamp1) is the master regulator of iron and its expression is induced by inflammation. Mice lacking Hamp1 from birth rapidly accumulate iron and are susceptible to infection by blood-dwelling siderophilic bacteria such as Vibrio vulnificus. In order to study the innate immune role of hepcidin against a background of normal iron status, we developed a transgenic mouse model of tamoxifen-sensitive conditional Hamp1 deletion (termed iHamp1-KO mice). These mice attain adulthood with an iron status indistinguishable from littermate controls. Hamp1 disruption and the consequent decline of serum hepcidin concentrations occurred within hours of a single tamoxifen dose. We found that the TLR ligands LPS and Pam3CSK4 and heat-killed Brucella abortus caused an equivalent induction of inflammation in control and iHamp1-KO mice. Pam3CSK4 and B. abortus only caused a drop in serum iron in control mice, while hypoferraemia due to LPS was evident but substantially blunted in iHamp1-KO mice. Our results characterise a powerful new model of rapidly inducible hepcidin disruption, and demonstrate the critical contribution of hepcidin to the hypoferraemia of inflammation.},

  abstract = {Ferritins are characterized by highly conserved three-dimensional structures similar to spherical shells, designed to accommodate large amounts of iron in a safe, soluble and bioavailable form. They can have different architectures with 12 or 24 equivalent or non-equivalent subunits, all surrounding a large cavity. All ferritins readily interact with Fe(II) to induce its oxidation and deposition in the cavity in a mineral form, in a reaction that is catalyzed by a ferroxidase center. This is an anti-oxidant activity that consumes Fe(II) and peroxides, the reagents that produce toxic free radicals in the Fenton reaction. The mechanism of ferritin iron incorporation has been characterized in detail, while that of iron release and recycling has been less thoroughly studied. Generally ferritin expression is regulated by iron and by oxidative damage, and in vertebrates it has a central role in the control of cellular iron homeostasis. Ferritin is mostly cytosolic but is found also in mammalian mitochondria and nuclei, in plant plastids and is secreted in insects. In vertebrates the cytosolic ferritins are composed of H and L subunit types and their assembly in a tissues specific ratio that permits flexibility to adapt to cell needs. The H-ferritin can translocate to the nuclei in some cell types to protect DNA from iron toxicity, or can be actively secreted, accomplishing various functions. The mitochondrial ferritin is found in mammals, it has a restricted tissue distribution and it seems to protect the mitochondria from iron toxicity and oxidative damage. The various functions attributed to the cytosolic, nuclear, secretory and mitochondrial ferritins are discussed.},

  abstract = {Repeated measures correlation (rmcorr) is a statistical technique for determining the common within-individual association for paired measures assessed on two or more occasions for multiple individuals. Simple regression/correlation is often applied to non-independent observations or aggregated data; this may produce biased, specious results due to violation of independence and/or differing patterns between-participants versus within-participants. Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr does not violate the assumption of independence of observations. Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because neither averaging nor aggregation is necessary for an intra-individual research question. Rmcorr estimates the common regression slope, the association shared among individuals. To make rmcorr accessible, we provide background information for its assumptions and equations, visualization, power, and tradeoffs with rmcorr compared to multilevel modeling. We introduce the R package (rmcorr) and demonstrate its use for inferential statistics and visualization with two example datasets. The examples are used to illustrate research questions at different levels of analysis, intra-individual, and inter-individual. Rmcorr is well-suited for research questions regarding the common linear association in paired repeated measures data. All results are fully reproducible.},

In animals, a family of proteins called transferrins are responsible for the sequestration, transport, and distribution of free iron. Comparison of the structure and function of transferrins with a completely unrelated protein hemopexin, which carries out the same function for heme, identifies molecular features that contribute to a successful protein system for iron acquisition, transport, and release. These include a two-domain protein structure with flexible hinges that allow these domains to enclose the bound ligand and provide suitable chemistry for stable binding and an appropriate trigger for release.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare subjective visual grading of pulmonary emphysema with macroscopic morphometry and computed tomographic (CT) densitometry.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 62 consecutive patients who underwent thin-section CT before surgical lung resection, emphysema was objectively quantified with computer-assisted macroscopic morphometry and CT densitometry. The percentage of lung macroscopically occupied by emphysema was compared with the percentage occupied on CT scans by pixels with attenuation values lower than a predefined threshold (CT densitometry). Three readers with varying degrees of expertise subjectively graded emphysema with visual assessment at two reading sessions. Data from objective quantification and subjective grading were analyzed with correlation coefficients, and interobserver and intraobserver agreement were calculated.RESULTS: Subjective grading of emphysema showed less agreement with the macroscopic reference standard results (r = 0.439–0.505; P {$<$} .05) than with objective CT densitometric results (r = 0.555–0.623; P {$<$} .001). The 95\% CIs for the intercepts of the linear regression lines were suggestive of systematic subjective overestimation of emphysema by all three readers. Interobserver agreement was moderate (κ = 0.431–0.589). Intraobserver agreement was good to excellent (κ = 0.738–0.936). The expertise of individual readers did not substantially influence results.CONCLUSION: Systematic overestimation and moderate interobserver agreement may compromise subjective visual grading of emphysema, which suggests that subjective visual grading should be supplemented with objective methods to achieve precise, reader-independent quantification of emphysema.},

Covariate information is collected from all failures and a representative sample of censored observations. Sampling is done without respect to time or disease status, and, therefore, the design is more flexible than a nested case-control design. Despite the efficiency of the methods, case-cohort designs are not often used because of perceived analytic complexity. In this article, we illustrate computation of a simple variance estimator and discuss model fitting techniques in SAS. Three different weighting methods are considered. Model fitting is demonstrated in an occupational exposure study of nickel refinery workers. The design is compared to a nested case-control design with respect to analysis and efficiency in a small simulation. In this example, case-cohort sampling from the full cohort was more efficient than using a comparable nested case-control design.},

  abstract = {Approximately half of the Canadian adults have sedentary lifestyles that increase their risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Women are 10 times more likely to die from CVD than from any other disease. Their risk almost doubles with the onset of menopause, which may result in increased body iron burden and oxidative stress in sedentary women. Body iron burden may catalyze the production of cytotoxic oxygen species in vivo. We hypothesized that postmenopausal women who engage in moderate forms of aerobic exercise for at least 30 min three or more times per week would have significantly (i) lower levels of body iron burden, (ii) increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and (iii) decreased oxidative stress in comparison to sedentary controls. An age-matched, case?control study was employed to examine the effects of active (N = 25) versus sedentary (N = 25) lifestyles in women aged 55?65 years on measures of body iron burden as quantified by total serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin levels; GPx activity; and oxidative stress as quantified by 4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde, and hexanal. Measures of body iron burden were significantly elevated in sedentary women in comparison to active women (p {$<$} .001). Red cell GPx activity was higher in active women compared to sedentary women (p {$<$} .001). Measures of oxidative stress were significantly higher in sedentary versus active women (p {$<$} .001). These findings suggest that aerobic forms of exercise may mitigate the risk of developing CVD in postmenopausal women by improving antioxidant capacity and decreasing body iron burden.},

Materials and methods We evaluated screening observations on women who participated between 2001–2003 in a cross-sectional, primary care-based sample of adults ages ≥25 y whose observations were complete: race/ethnicity; age; transferrin saturation; serum ferritin; and HFE p.C282Y and p.H63D alleles. We defined ID using a stringent criterion: combined transferrin saturation {$<$}10\% and serum ferritin {$<$}33.7 pmol/L ({$<$}15 μg/L). We compared ID prevalence in women of different race/ethnicity subgrouped by age and determined associations of p.C282Y and p.H63D to ID overall, and to ID in women ages 25–44 y with or without self-reported pregnancy. Results These 62,685 women included 27,079 whites, 17,272 blacks, 8,566 Hispanics, 7,615 Asians, 449 Pacific Islanders, 441 Native Americans, and 1,263 participants of other race/ethnicity. Proportions of women with ID were higher in Hispanics and blacks than whites and Asians. Prevalence of ID was significantly greater in women ages 25–54 y of all race/ethnicity groups than women ages ≥55 y of corresponding race/ethnicity. In women ages ≥55 y, ID prevalence did not differ significantly across race/ethnicity. p.C282Y and p.H63D prevalence did not differ significantly in women with or without ID, regardless of race/ethnicity, age subgroup, or pregnancy. Conclusions ID prevalence was greater in Hispanic and black than white and Asian women ages 25–54 y. p.C282Y and p.H63D prevalence did not differ significantly in women with or without ID, regardless of race/ethnicity, age subgroup, or pregnancy.},

Selenium is an essential trace element in human nutrition. It has been studied at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) for the past 15 years using an Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) technique. The principal route of human exposure to selenium is through the diet. Selenium concentrations of nails, blood, hair, and urine have been used as indicators of dietary selenium intake. In this study, a cohort consisting of seven men and five women ingested three selenium supplements of 150 mu g each over a three day period. The selenium was enriched in Se-76 (96.48\%) and ingested as selenite in orange juice following an overnight fast. Fingernails and toenails were collected prior to the selenium supplementation and for several months afterward to be used as biochemical indicators. The peak Se-76 concentration in the fingernails and toenails occurred at 19-23 and 16-32 weeks after supplementation, respectively.},

  abstract = {Ovarian cancer is a lethal malignancy that has not seen a major therapeutic advance in over 30 years. We demonstrate that ovarian cancer exhibits a targetable alteration in iron metabolism. Ferroportin (FPN), the iron efflux pump, is decreased, and transferrin receptor (TFR1), the iron importer, is increased in tumor tissue from patients with high grade but not low grade serous ovarian cancer. A similar profile of decreased FPN and increased TFR1 is observed in a genetic model of ovarian cancer tumor-initiating cells (TICs). The net result of these changes is an accumulation of excess intracellular iron and an augmented dependence on iron for proliferation. A forced reduction in intracellular iron reduces the proliferation of ovarian cancer TICs in vitro, and inhibits both tumor growth and intraperitoneal dissemination of tumor cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that iron increases metastatic spread by facilitating invasion through expression of matrix metalloproteases and synthesis of interleukin 6 (IL-6). We show that the iron dependence of ovarian cancer TICs renders them exquisitely sensitive in vivo to agents that induce iron-dependent cell death (ferroptosis) as well as iron chelators, and thus creates a metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited therapeutically.},

  abstract = {Iron deficiency is a concern in both developing and developed (industrialized) countries; and young women are particularly vulnerable. This review investigates dietary determinants of and possible solutions to iron deficiency in young women living in industrialized countries. Dietary factors including ascorbic acid and an elusive factor in animal protein foods (meat; fish and poultry) enhance iron absorption; while phytic acid; soy protein; calcium and polyphenols inhibit iron absorption. However; the effects of these dietary factors on iron absorption do not necessarily translate into an association with iron status and iron stores (serum ferritin concentration). In cross-sectional studies; only meat intake has consistently (positively) been associated with higher serum ferritin concentrations. The enhancing effects of ascorbic acid and meat on iron absorption may be negated by the simultaneous consumption of foods and nutrients which are inhibitory. Recent cross-sectional studies have considered the combination and timing of foods consumed; with mixed results. Dietary interventions using a range of focused dietary measures to improve iron status appear to be more effective than dietary approaches that focus on single nutrients or foods. Further research is needed to determine optimal dietary recommendations for both the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency.},

  abstract = {Background: Principal component analysis (PCA) has been used extensively to derive dietary patterns. We proposed to use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in the same context as PCA—as a one-step approach—to derive dietary patterns. Objectives: The first aim of this study was methodologic and was to compare dietary patterns derived with the use of PCA and CFA, used as equivalent one-step approaches. The second aim of this study was to study these patterns in association with individual characteristics and new adult-onset asthma. Methods: We included 30,589 French women from the E3N (epidemiologic prospective cohort study of women from the MGEN national insurance plan) with 1177 reported cases of adult-onset asthma between 1993 and 2005. PCA and CFA were used in the same context, on 27 food groups, to derive dietary patterns. Associations between dietary patterns and adult-onset asthma were assessed by Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Whether we used PCA or CFA, 3 similar factors were found and labeled ‘‘Prudent,’’ ‘‘Western,’’ and ‘‘Aperitif.’’ Correlations between patterns derived with the use of PCA and CFA were high. For the ‘‘Prudent’’ and ‘‘Aperitif’’ patterns, we observed comparable patterns in terms of associations with food groups, individual characteristics, and the onset of asthma. For the ‘‘Western’’ patterns, the one derived with the use of CFA was more related to an unhealthy diet than the one derived with the use of PCA, with higher correlations with the food groups ‘‘processed meat’’ (0.73 vs. 0.51) and ‘‘dough and pastry’’ (0.63 vs. 0.40), and negative associations with physical activity and with having parents who were farmers. Regarding associations with adult-onset asthma, a significant positive association was observed for the ‘‘Western’’ pattern derived with the use of CFA [multivariate RR for highest vs. lowest quintile: 1.30 (1.02, 1.67), P-trend: 0.03], whereas no association was reported when using PCA [RR: 1.14 (0.89, 1.47), P-trend: 0.40]. Conclusion: Although quite similar dietary patterns were derived with the use of PCA and CFA, this study supports the alternative use of CFA to PCA for the identification of dietary patterns in epidemiologic studies.

We performed a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies from Iceland, the UK and Denmark of blood levels of ferritin (N\,=\,246,139), total iron binding capacity (N\,=\,135,430), iron (N\,=\,163,511) and transferrin saturation (N\,=\,131,471). We found 62 independent sequence variants associating with iron homeostasis parameters at 56 loci, including 46 novel loci. Variants at DUOX2, F5, SLC11A2 and TMPRSS6 associate with iron deficiency anemia, while variants at TF, HFE, TFR2 and TMPRSS6 associate with iron overload. A HBS1L-MYB intergenic region variant associates both with increased risk of iron overload and reduced risk of iron deficiency anemia. The DUOX2 missense variant is present in 14\% of the population, associates with all iron homeostasis biomarkers, and increases the risk of iron deficiency anemia by 29\%. The associations implicate proteins contributing to the main physiological processes involved in iron homeostasis: iron sensing and storage, inflammation, absorption of iron from the gut, iron recycling, erythropoiesis and bleeding/menstruation.},

The aim of the present study was to determine the number of days for blood sampling required in order to measure the ‘true value’ of five Fe-status parameters in young Fe-depleted women and to investigate the effect of menstrual cycle on these measures. Twelve women (aged 23–30 years), non-anaemic but with low Fe stores, participated in the study. Venous blood samples were collected under standardised conditions on fifteen non-consecutive days during a 5-week period. All blood samples were analysed for Hb, serum ferritin (SF), serum transferrin receptors (sTfR), red blood cell volume distribution width (RDW) and reticulocytes (RET), and body Fe stores were calculated as the ratio between sTfR and SF. No systematic changes were found in the investigated parameters during the study. When analytical variations were accounted for, the day-to-day variations (CV\%) were as follows: Hb 2·9 \%, SF 8·2 \%, RET 26·0 \%, RDW 2·4 \% and sTfR 8·1 \%. Calculating the ‘true value’ with a 5 \% significance level and 80 \% power showed that one blood sample was sufficient for Hb, SF, sTfR and RDW, whereas seven blood-sampling days were needed for RET. In this study, no significant differences in Fe status were found across the menstrual cycle. The conclusions from this study are valid for studies conducted under similar strict conditions.},

It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation. Whereas the design shares many properties of regression-based approaches in other epidemiological studies, there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations. In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.},

  abstract = {Purpose Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced type 2 diabetes risk, but the biomarkers that explain this relation are unknown. The most commonly used method to estimate the proportion explained by a biomarker is the difference method. However, influence of alcohol–biomarker interaction on its results is unclear. G-estimation method is proposed to accurately assess proportion explained, but how this method compares with the difference method is unknown. Methods In a case–cohort study of 2498 controls and 919 incident diabetes cases, we estimated the proportion explained by different biomarkers on the relation between alcohol consumption and diabetes using the difference method and sequential G-estimation method. Results Using the difference method, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol explained the relation between alcohol and diabetes by 78\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 41–243), whereas high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (−7.5\%;~−36.4 to 1.8) or blood pressure (−6.9;~−26.3 to~−0.6) did not explain the relation. Interaction between alcohol and liver enzymes led to bias in proportion explained with different outcomes for different levels of liver enzymes. G-estimation method showed comparable results, but proportions explained were lower. Conclusions The relation between alcohol consumption and diabetes may be largely explained by increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but not by other biomarkers. Ignoring exposure–mediator interactions may result in bias. The difference and G-estimation methods provide similar results.},

In this article, we describe the general features of time series data, and we outline the analysis process, beginning with descriptive analysis, then focusing on issues in time series regression that differ from other regression methods: modelling short-term fluctuations in the presence of seasonal and long-term patterns, dealing with time varying confounding factors and modelling delayed (‘lagged’) associations between exposure and outcome. We finish with advice on model checking and sensitivity analysis, and some common extensions to the basic model.},

  abstract = {Principal components analysis (PCA) is a common method to summarize a larger set of correlated variables into a smaller and more easily interpretable axes of variation. However, the different components need to be distinct from each other to be interpretable otherwise they only represent random directions. This is a fundamental assumption of PCA and, thus, needs to be tested every time. Sample correlation matrices will always result in a pattern of decreasing eigenvalues even if there is no structure. Tests are, therefore, needed to discern real patterns from illusionary ones. Furthermore, the loadings of the vectors need to be larger than expected by random data to be useful in the calculation of PC-scores. PC-scores calculated from nondistinct PC's have very large standard errors and cannot be used for biological interpretations. I give a number of examples to illustrate the potential problems with PCA. Robustness of the PC's increases with increasing sample size but not with the number of traits. I review a few simple test statistics appropriate for testing PC's and use a real-world example to illustrate how this can be done using randomization tests. PCA can be very useful but great care is needed to avoid spurious results.},

The questionnaire produced group mean nutrient estimates closely approximating the values obtained by three 4-day records, e.g. in the usual-diet group, 37.7\% of calories from fat by both food records and by questionnaire, and in the low-fat, group, 21.3\% of calories from fat by food records and 23.7\% of calories from fat by questionnaire. Correlations between questionnaire and diet records for per cent of calories from fat were 0.67 and 0.65 respectively in the two groups; most correlations were in the 0.5–0.6 range, and were similar to those achievable by a single 4-day food record.},

The predicted duration of 25(OH)D concentrations \&lt; 50 nmol/L was 250 d/y in women and 165 d/y in men.Conclusion: Seasonal variation significantly affects the diagnosis of vitamin D sufficiency, which requires seasonally adjusted thresholds individualized for different locations. Clinicians should consider the month of sampling and the amount of body fat when interpreting 25(OH)D measurements.},

The chapter moves to model specification for confirmatory factor analysis, followed by sections on the implied covariance matrix, identification, estimation, the evaluation of model fit, comparisons of models, diagnostics for misspecified models, and extensions of the model. It discusses several means to respecify models and to test the fit of the revised models. The chapter covers first the use of theory or substantive expertise. Next it explains the exploratory applications of the LR, LM, and W statistics. Finally the chapter reviews several miscellaneous empirical means of respecification. It shows that the extensions of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) line separating measurement models from latent variable models become blurred.},

  abstract = {In case-control studies one may employ logistic regression to model the relationship between binary responses and continuous predictor variables that have been categorized by the empirical quartiles of the controls. Sometimes, however, systematic trends over time (or drifts) contaminate the laboratory measurements of predictor variables. In this paper we consider the use of locally weighted robust regression (lowess) to estimate and remove these systematic trends when the trends for the cases and controls have a common shape. One can then use the lowess adjusted data in the desired logistic regression model. We illustrate these methods with a case-control study that was designed to assess the risk of oesophageal cancer as a function of the quartile categories of sphinganine levels in the blood serum. Upon examination of the data, it was discovered that the sphinganine laboratory measurements were contaminated by a systematic trend, the magnitude of which depended only on the day of analysis. This trend needed to be removed before performing further analyses of the data. In addition, we present simulations to examine the use of lowess methods to estimate and remove various shapes of trends from contaminated predictor data before constructing logistic regression models with quartile categories. We found that using the trend-contaminated data tends to give attenuated parameter estimates and hence lower significance and power levels than using the uncontaminated data. Conversely, using appropriate lowess methods to adjust the data tends to give nearly unbiased parameter estimates, near nominal significance levels, and improved power.

Acquired iron overload is mainly due to multiple transfusions and to dyserythropoiesis. The damaging effect of iron excess concerns numerous organs and can therefore lead to miscellaneous clinical features, related especially to the liver, heart, pancreas, and rheumatological complications. Those complications alter not only the quality of life but also life expectancy. The diagnostic approach has become essentially noninvasive. It rests – beside clinical examination – on serum iron parameters (especially ferritin and transferrin saturation), on iron MRI, and, whenever indicated, on genetic testing. The treatment, in hepcidin deficiency-related iron overload, remains based on venesection therapy but should resort in the future to hepcidin supplementation. Posttransfusional iron overload has greatly benefited from the design of oral iron chelators.},

  abstract = {Despite decades of laboratory, epidemiological and clinical research, breast cancer incidence continues to rise. Breast cancer remains the leading cancer-r elated cause of disease burden for women, affecting one in 20 globally and as many as one in eight in high-income countries. Reducing breast cancer incidence will likely require both a population-b ased approach of reducing exposure to modifiable risk factors and a precision-p revention approach of identifying women at increased risk and targeting them for specific interventions, such as risk-reducing medication. We already have the capacity to estimate an individual woman’s breast cancer risk using validated risk assessment models, and the accuracy of these models is likely to continue to improve over time, particularly with inclusion of newer risk factors, such as polygenic risk and mammographic density. Evidence-based risk-r educing medications are cheap, widely available and recommended by professional health bodies; however, widespread implementation of these has proven challenging. The barriers to uptake of, and adherence to, current medications will need to be considered as we deepen our understanding of breast cancer initiation and begin developing and testing novel preventives.},

  abstract = {Iron is an essential nutrient that plays a complex role in cancer biology. Iron metabolism must be tightly controlled within cells. Whilst fundamental to many cellular processes and required for cell survival, excess labile iron is toxic to cells. Increased iron metabolism is associated with malignant transformation, cancer progression, drug resistance and immune evasion. Depleting intracellular iron stores, either with the use of iron chelating agents or mimicking endogenous regulation mechanisms such as microRNAs, present attractive therapeutic opportunities, some of which are currently under clinical investigation. Alternatively, iron overload can result in a form of regulated cell death, ferroptosis, which can be activated in cancer cells presenting an alternative anti-cancer strategy. This review focuses on alterations in iron metabolism that enable cancer cells to meet metabolic demands required during different stages of tumorigenesis in relation to metastasis and immune response. The strength of current evidence is considered, gaps in knowledge are highlighted and controversies relating to the role of iron and therapeutic targeting potential are discussed.

  abstract = {Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), encoded by the SOD2 gene, is involved in the detoxification of superoxide anion. Superoxide is likely a source of oxidative stress in the cochlea following treatment with platinum agents and radiation. Therefore, we examined SOD2 variants in association with ototoxicity among cisplatin-treated childhood medulloblastoma patients. Blood samples were obtained from 71 eligible patients treated for pediatric medulloblastoma at Texas Children's Cancer Center (1987–2010). Ototoxicity was defined as requiring the use of a hearing aid sometime after the initiation of therapy. DNA was genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmni-1 Quad BeadChip. A linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection strategy was used to identify a minimal set of informative variants. Associations between SNPs and ototoxicity were assessed using logistic regression. Of the 71 eligible patients, 26 (37\%) suffered from cisplatin-related ototoxicity. Study participants were primarily male (73\%) and non-Hispanic white (42\%). Five SOD2 variants (rs7855, rs5746151, rs5746136, rs2758331, and rs4880) identified by the LD-based selection strategy were genotyped. After correcting for multiple comparisons, the C-allele of the rs4880 variant was significantly associated with ototoxicity (odds ratio = 3.06, 95\% confidence interval: 1.30–7.20) in adjusted models. The rs4880 T {$>$} C substitution results in a Val {$>$} Ala amino acid change at position 16 of the MnSOD mitochondrial targeting sequence. The Ala variant, which has been associated with increased MnSOD activity, was associated with hearing damage in this study. Platinum-based therapies increase the expression of MnSOD, which may result in an abundance of hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species. Therefore, oxidative stress may be an important mechanism in therapy-related cochlear damage.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization is the use of genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. The total causal effect of a risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from intervening on the risk factor. This total causal effect may potentially encompass multiple mediating mechanisms. For a proposed mediator, the direct effect of the risk factor is the change in the outcome resulting from a change in the risk factor, keeping the mediator constant. A difference between the total effect and the direct effect indicates that the causal pathway from the risk factor to the outcome acts at least in part via the mediator (an indirect effect). Here, we show that Mendelian randomization estimates of total and direct effects can be obtained using summarized data on genetic associations with the risk factor, mediator, and outcome, potentially from different data sources. We perform simulations to test the validity of this approach when there is unmeasured confounding and/or bidirectional effects between the risk factor and mediator. We illustrate this method using the relationship between age at menarche and risk of breast cancer, with body mass index (BMI) as a potential mediator. We show an inverse direct causal effect of age at menarche on risk of breast cancer (independent of BMI), and a positive indirect effect via BMI. In conclusion, multivariable Mendelian randomization using summarized genetic data provides a rapid and accessible analytic strategy that can be undertaken using publicly available data to better understand causal mechanisms.},

Frequently, studies enroll participants over a range of ages including ages at which some participants’ milestones have already passed. Ages at milestones that occur prior to study entry are left censored if individuals are enrolled in the study or left truncated if they are not. The authors examined the bias incurred by ignoring these issues when estimating the distribution of age at milestones or the time between 2 milestones. Methods that account for left truncation and censoring are considered. Data on the menopausal transition are used to illustrate the problem. Simulations show that bias can be substantial and that standard errors can be severely underestimated in naïve analyses that ignore left truncation. Bias can be reduced when analyses account for left truncation, although the results are unstable when the fraction truncated is high. Simulations suggest that a better solution, when possible, is to modify the study design so that information on current status (i.e., whether or not a milestone has passed) is collected on all potential participants, analyzing those who are past the milestone at the time of recruitment as left censored rather than excluding such individuals from the analysis.},

  abstract = {Iron deficiency (ID) with or without anemia is common worldwide. ID is a broad definition encompassing decreased total body iron (absolute deficiency) as well as reduced iron supply to erythropoietic and/or other organs with preserved stores (functional iron deficiency, FID), as it occurs in inflammation. Increased iron needs unbalanced by iron supply, low iron intake, reduced absorption and chronic blood loss, often in combination, are the main causes of absolute ID, easily diagnosed by low ferritin levels. In all these cases hepcidin synthesis is repressed, while in FID is augmented by inflammatory cytokines, causing iron sequestration in stores. Because of increased ferritin levels diagnosis of ID in the latter condition may be tricky: global clinical evaluation, accepted threshold of iron tests together with response to iron treatment may be of help. Search and removal of the responsible cause(s) is as important as diagnosing ID or FID. The response to oral iron treatment is suboptimal when hepcidin levels are high. Future research is needed to establish/validate markers for improved diagnosis of complex cases and to test the therapeutic value of drugs under development aimed at interfering with the altered iron trafficking.},

We argue that orthogonal regression is often misused in errors-in-variables linear regression because of a failure to account for equation errors. The typical result is to overcorrect for measurement error, that is, overestimate the slope, because equation error is ignored. The use of orthogonal regression must include a careful assessment of equation error, and not merely the usual (often informal) estimation of the ratio of measurement error variances. There are rarer instances, for example, an example from geology discussed here, where the use of orthogonal regression without proper attention to modeling may lead to either overcorrection or undercorrection, depending on the relative sizes of the variances involved. Thus our main point, which does not seem to be widely appreciated, is that orthogonal regression, just like any measurement error analysis, requires careful modeling of error.},

  abstract = {Background: Iron has been shown to enhance breast carcinogenesis in animal models through generation of oxidative stress, although epidemiological evidence of the association between iron intake and breast cancer risk remains inconclusive. This study investigated associations between different types of iron intake and breast cancer risk, and whether these associations were modified by genetic polymorphisms in antioxidant enzymes, including manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione S-transferases M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1). Methods: A population-based case-control study in Ontario, Canada recruited 3,030 breast cancer cases identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry and 3,402 controls from random digit dialing. Iron intake from foods and supplements was assessed using a 178-item food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between breast cancer risk and intakes of dietary, supplemental, and total (dietary plus supplemental) iron, among all women and stratified by menopausal status. Associations were also examined by hormone receptor [estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)] tumor subtype. Among women providing saliva (DNA) samples (1,696 cases and 1,761 controls), interactions between iron intake and genetic polymorphisms were assessed using the likelihood ratio test. Results: Among all women, intakes of dietary, supplemental, and total iron were not associated with breast cancer risk, overall or by tumor subtype. Among premenopausal women, there was an increase in breast cancer risk for the ER–PR– subtype associated with higher intakes (highest vs. lowest quintile) of dietary [odds ratio (OR) = 1.4; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.9–2.4] and total (OR = 1.8; 95\% CI: 1.1–2.9) iron (P for trend {$<$} 0.05). Among postmenopausal women, supplemental iron intake ({$>$}18 vs. 0 mg/day) was associated with reduced breast cancer risk (OR = 0.7; 95\% CI: 0.5–0.9), with similar associations across tumor subtypes. Associations of dietary and total iron intake with overall breast cancer risk were modified by GSTT1 and/or GSTM1/T1 combined genotypes (P for interaction {$<$} 0.05). For example, among women with deletions in both GSTM1 and GSTT1 loci, higher dietary iron intake was associated with increased breast cancer risk (OR = 2.1; 95\% CI: 1.1–4.2), whereas null or inverse associations were found among women with other GSTM1/T1 genotypes. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that higher dietary and total iron intake may be associated with increased risk of ER–PR– breast cancer among premenopausal women, whereas higher supplemental iron intake may be associated with reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. In addition, associations between iron intake and breast cancer risk may be modified by polymorphisms in oxidative stress-related genes. Our ongoing work will investigate heme and non-heme iron intake in relation to breast cancer risk. Citation Format: Vicky C. Chang, Michelle Cotterchio, Susan J. Bondy, Joanne Kotsopoulos.

  abstract = {Statin therapy may improve responsiveness to erythropoietin-stimulating agents in patients with end-stage renal disease. Although statins increase hepatic iron uptake and storage capacity in cholestatic rats, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we examined the effects of a statin (simvastatin) on the expression of hepcidin, erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and erythropoietin (EPO) in cultured HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells (6–6.5 × 105 cells) were seeded in 6-cm dishes and incubated overnight. The cells were then treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, or 10 μM simvastatin, and the mRNA expression of hepcidin, EPOR, and EPO was determined. Data were collected from three independent experiments. The cDNA extracted from the cells was used as a template for real-time polymerase chain reaction, and each sample was tested in duplicate. Significant differences (P {$<$} 0.05) among groups were determined using one-way analysis of variance with Fisher's least significant difference post hoc test. Data were adjusted using Bonferroni's method. The relative mRNA expression of hepcidin in HepG2 cells treated with 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 10 μM simvastatin, relative to the control group, was 0.7273, 0.3303, 0.2418, 0.4131, and 0.4064, respectively. The relative mRNA expression of EPOR was 0.5196, 0.2319, 0.2398, 0.4253, and 0.1245, respectively, while that of EPO was 0.9751, 0.4712, 0.4613, 0.4875, and 0.1654. There was a reverse dose-dependent effect of simvastatin. These results suggest that statins increase erythropoiesis by targeting hepcidin and iron regulatory pathways, independent of erythropoietin.},

  abstract = {Background: Deferoxamine (DFO) is a commonly used iron chelator, which can reduce the iron levels in cells. DFO is normally used to treat iron-overload disease, including some types of cancer. However, our previous studies revealed that DFO treatment significantly increased the iron concentrations in triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBCs) resulting in enhanced cell migration. But the mechanism of DFO-induced increasing iron uptake in aggressive TNBCs still remained unclear. Materials and methods: Iron metabolism-related proteins in aggressive breast cancer MDA-MB-231, HS578T and BT549 cells and nonaggressive breast cancer MCF-7 and T47D cells were examined by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The possible regulatory mechanism was explored by Western blotting, co-incubation with neutralizing antibodies or inhibitors, and transwell assay. Results: In this study, we found that DFO treatment significantly increased the levels of iron uptake proteins, DMT1 and TfR1, in aggressive TNBCs. Moreover, both TfR1 and DMT1 expressed on cell membrane were involved in high iron uptake in TNBCs under DFO-induced iron deficient condition. For the possible regulatory mechanism, we found that DFO treatment could promote a high expression level of IL-6 in aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells. The activated IL-6/PI3K/AKT pathway upregulated the expression of iron-uptake related proteins, TfR1 and DMT1, leading to increased iron uptakes. Conclusion: We demonstrated that DFO could upregulate expression of TfR1 and DMT1, which enhanced iron uptake via activating IL-6/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in aggressive TNBCs.},

  abstract = {Objective To clarify the urinary arsenic metabolism characteristics in individuals with essential hypertension and to analyze the relationship between lipid metabolism gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to essential hypertension in individuals in high-arsenic areas in western China. Methods A case-control study was conducted and involved individuals exposed to high arsenic levels (in this study, the arsenic content in the pressurized well water was 0–510.2 μg/L, and that in the mechanical well water was 167 μg/L) in two adjacent high-arsenic areas in Shanxi Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. A total of 699 samples were collected, including 192 case samples (patients with hypertension) and 507 control samples (no hypertension). Blood pressure measurement data obtained from an epidemiological survey were used to determine whether the subjects had hypertension, and a logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between lipid metabolism gene polymorphisms and hypertension susceptibility. Blood and urine samples were collected based on epidemiological methods, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using a SNPscan™ multiple SNP typing kit, and urinary arsenic concentrations were determined using the hydride generation atomic fluorescence method (HG-AFS). Results ADIPOQ/rs266729 was the dominant genetic model [(GC + GG) vs CC = 0.686:1, 95 \% CI = 0.478−0.983], and FABP2/rs1799883 was the recessive genetic model [TT vs (CC + TC) = 1.690:1, 95 \% CI = 1.014–2.816]. The distribution of the urinary arsenic secondary methylation ratio (SMR) [dimethylated arsenic (DMA)/monomethylated arsenic (MMA)] was different between hypertensive patients and controls. Conclusion ADIPOQ/rs266729 and FABP2/rs1799883 polymorphisms affect susceptibility to essential hypertension in individuals exposed to high levels of arsenic; there was a clear difference in the urinary arsenic metabolism pattern between hypertensive patients and controls.},

  abstract = {Nail plate brittleness (or fragility) is a common complaint affecting up to 20\% of the population, especially women over 50~years of age, with fingernail fragility being more prevalent than toenail fragility. Nail brittleness is characterized by nails that split, flake and crumble, become soft and lose elasticity. The main clinical presentations are: onychoschizia, onychorrhexis, superficial granulation of keratin and worn-down nails. According to causative factors, we can distinguish 2 forms of nail fragility (NF): a primary “idiopathic or brittle nail syndrome” form and NF secondary to different causes such as inflammatory nail disorders, infections, systemic diseases and general conditions, traumas and alteration of the nail hydration. Optimal management requires treatment of the primary cause of brittle nails, when possible. In idiopathic NF oral supplementation, vitamins (especially biotin, also known as vitamin B7), trace elements and amino acids (especially cysteine) have been reported to be useful. In addition, several products, such as topical moisturizers and lacquers could be considered to restructure the affected nail plate and to reduce psychological impacts of this common problem.},

  abstract = {Changes in iron regulation characterize the malignant state. However, the pathways that effect these changes and their specific impact on prognosis remain poorly understood. We capitalized on publicly available microarray datasets comprising 674 breast cancer cases to systematically investigate how expression of genes related to iron metabolism is linked to breast cancer prognosis. Of 61 genes involved in iron regulation, 49\% were statistically significantly associated with distant metastasis-free survival. Cases were divided into test and training cohorts, and the supervised principal component method was used to stratify cases into risk groups. Optimal risk stratification was achieved with a model comprising 16 genes, which we term the iron regulatory gene signature (IRGS). Multivariable analysis revealed that the IRGS contributes information not captured by conventional prognostic indicators (HR ¼ 1.61; 95\% confidence interval: 1.16–2.24; P ¼ 0.004). The IRGS successfully stratified homogeneously treated patients, including ERþ patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy, both with (P ¼ 0.006) and without (P ¼ 0.03) lymph node metastases. To test whether multiple pathways were embedded within the IRGS, we evaluated the performance of two gene dyads with known roles in iron biology in ERþ patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy (n ¼ 371). For both dyads, gene combinations that minimized intracellular iron content [anti-import: TFRCLow/HFEHigh; or pro-export: SLC40A1 (ferroportin)High/ HAMPLow] were associated with favorable prognosis (P {$<$} 0.005). Although the clinical utility of the IRGS will require further evaluation, its ability to both identify high-risk patients within traditionally low-risk groups and low-risk patients within high-risk groups has the potential to affect therapeutic decision making.

  abstract = {Selenium is an essential trace element important to neurotransmission, but toxic at high levels. Some studies suggest beneficial effects on mood. We assessed the association of selenium exposure with presence of depressive symptoms. Selenium exposure was measured in toenail samples collected in 1987 from 3735 US participants (age 20–32 years) and depressive symptoms assessed in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Binary and polytomous logistic regression models were used to assess the relation of log2(selenium) and selenium quintiles with presence of depressive symptoms (CES-D score≥27 or on antidepressant medication). Relative to selenium quintile 1, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for having depressive symptoms in 1990 for quintile 5 was 1.59 (95\% CI: 1.01, 2.51) and a unit increase in log2(selenium), which represents a doubling of the selenium level, was associated with an OR=2.03 (95\% CI: 1.12, 3.70). When examining 1, 2 or 3+ exams vs. no exams with symptoms, the OR for quintile 5 was 1.73 (1.04, 2.89) for 3+ exams and for one exam and two exams, there were no associations. In a generalized estimating equations longitudinal model, a doubling of the selenium level was associated with a 56\% higher odds of having depressive symptoms at an exam. Contrary to previously reported findings related to mood, higher level of selenium exposure was associated with presence of elevated depressive symptoms. More research is needed to elucidate the role of selenium in depressive disorders.},

On the basis of a method previously established in younger and older adults, biological (sigma 2 day) and analytical (sigma 2 rep) variance components were computed and summed to obtain the total day-to-day intraindividual variability (sigma 2 tot). The total day-to-day intraindividual CV (CVtot) was lower for TfR than for ferritin measurements. One to two discrete blood samples are required to accurately determine capillary and venous TfR, whereas capillary and venous ferritin, which have a higher CVtot, require three to six samples. Results from the current study showing the low biological and analytical variability of TfR support the use of this new test for assessing a person’s iron status.},

However, which specific factors affect risk and the strength of these effects are unknown. We aimed to examine the relationship between potentially modifiable risk factors and colorectal cancer.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We used a random-effects model to examine the relationship between 39 potentially modifiable risk factors and colorectal cancer in 26 397 patients with colorectal cancer and 41 481 controls (ie, people without colorectal cancer). These population data came from a genome-wide association study of people of European ancestry, which was amended to exclude UK BioBank data. In the model, we used genetic variants as instruments via two-sample mendelian randomisation to limit bias from confounding and reverse causation. We calculated odds ratios per genetically predicted SD unit increase in each putative risk factor (OR\textsubscript{SD}) for colorectal cancer risk. We did mendelian randomisation Egger regressions to identify evidence of potential violations of mendelian randomisation assumptions. A Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p=1·3 × 10\textsuperscript{−3} was considered significant, and p values less than 0·05 were considered to be suggestive of an association.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}No putative risk factors were significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk after correction for multiple testing. However, suggestive associations with increased risk were noted for genetically predicted body fat percentage (OR\textsubscript{SD} 1·14 [95\% CI 1·03–1·25]; p=0·0086), body-mass index (1·09 [1·01–1·17]; p=0·023), waist circumference (1·13 [1·02–1·26]; p=0·018), basal metabolic rate (1·10 [1·03–1·18]; p=0·0079), and concentrations of LDL cholesterol (1·14 [1·04–1·25]; p=0·0056), total cholesterol (1·09 [1·01–1·18]; p=0·025), circulating serum iron (1·17 [1·00–1·36]; p=0·049), and serum vitamin B12 (1·21 [1·04–1·42]; p=0·016), although potential pleiotropy among genetic variants used as instruments for vitamin B12 constrains the finding. A suggestive association was also noted between adult height and increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR\textsubscript{SD} 1·04 [95\% CI 1·00–1·08]; p=0·032). Low blood selenium concentration had a suggestive association with decreased risk of colorectal cancer (OR\textsubscript{SD} 0·85 [95\% CI 0·75–0·96]; p=0·0078) based on a single variant, as did plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 receptor subunit α (also based on a single variant; 0·98 [0·96–1·00]; p=0·035).

We aimed to examine the relationship between potentially modifiable risk factors and colorectal cancer.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We used a random-effects model to examine the relationship between 39 potentially modifiable risk factors and colorectal cancer in 26 397 patients with colorectal cancer and 41 481 controls (ie, people without colorectal cancer). These population data came from a genome-wide association study of people of European ancestry, which was amended to exclude UK BioBank data. In the model, we used genetic variants as instruments via two-sample mendelian randomisation to limit bias from confounding and reverse causation. We calculated odds ratios per genetically predicted SD unit increase in each putative risk factor (OR\textsubscript{SD}) for colorectal cancer risk. We did mendelian randomisation Egger regressions to identify evidence of potential violations of mendelian randomisation assumptions. A Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p=1·3 × 10\textsuperscript{−3} was considered significant, and p values less than 0·05 were considered to be suggestive of an association.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}No putative risk factors were significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk after correction for multiple testing. However, suggestive associations with increased risk were noted for genetically predicted body fat percentage (OR\textsubscript{SD} 1·14 [95\% CI 1·03–1·25]; p=0·0086), body-mass index (1·09 [1·01–1·17]; p=0·023), waist circumference (1·13 [1·02–1·26]; p=0·018), basal metabolic rate (1·10 [1·03–1·18]; p=0·0079), and concentrations of LDL cholesterol (1·14 [1·04–1·25]; p=0·0056), total cholesterol (1·09 [1·01–1·18]; p=0·025), circulating serum iron (1·17 [1·00–1·36]; p=0·049), and serum vitamin B12 (1·21 [1·04–1·42]; p=0·016), although potential pleiotropy among genetic variants used as instruments for vitamin B12 constrains the finding. A suggestive association was also noted between adult height and increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR\textsubscript{SD} 1·04 [95\% CI 1·00–1·08]; p=0·032). Low blood selenium concentration had a suggestive association with decreased risk of colorectal cancer (OR\textsubscript{SD} 0·85 [95\% CI 0·75–0·96]; p=0·0078) based on a single variant, as did plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 receptor subunit α (also based on a single variant; 0·98 [0·96–1·00]; p=0·035).

Here we identified a subset of iron-loaded, pro-inflammatory TAMs localized in hemorrhagic areas of the tumor microenvironment. The occurrence of iron-loaded TAMs (iTAMs) correlated with reduced tumor size in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Ex vivo experiments established that TAMs exposed to hemolytic red blood cells were converted into pro-inflammatory macrophages capable of directly killing tumor cells. This anti-tumor effect could also be elicited via iron oxide nanoparticles. When tested in vivo, tumors injected with such iron oxide nanoparticles led to significantly smaller tumor sizes compared to controls. These results identify hemolytic red blood cells and iron as novel players in the tumor microenvironment that repolarize TAMs to exert direct anti-tumor effector function. Thus, the delivery of iron to TAMs emerges as a simple adjuvant therapeutic strategy to promote anti-cancer immune responses.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and is considered a developed country disease. Moreover, is a heterogenous disease, existing different types and stages of breast cancer development, therefore, better understanding of cancer biology, helps to improve the development of therapies. The conventional treatments accessible after diagnosis, have the main goal of controlling the disease, by improving survival. In more advance stages the aim is to prolong life and symptom palliation care. Surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are the main options available, which must be adapted to each person individually. However, patients are developing resistance to the conventional therapies. This resistance is due to alterations in important regulatory pathways such as PI3K/AKt/mTOR, this pathway contributes to trastuzumab resistance, a reference drug to treat breast cancer. Therefore, is proposed the repurposing of drugs, instead of developing drugs de novo, for example, to seek new medical treatments within the drugs available, to be used in breast cancer treatment. Providing safe and tolerable treatments to patients, and new insights to efficacy and efficiency of breast cancer treatments. The economic and social burden of cancer is enormous so it must be taken measures to relieve this burden and to ensure continued access to therapies to all patients. In this review we focus on how conventional therapies against breast cancer are leading to resistance, by reviewing those mechanisms and discussing the efficacy of repurposed drugs to fight breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts the body’s regulation of iron. It is the most common genetic disease in whites. Men have a 24-fold increased rate of iron-overload disease compared with women. Persons who are homozygous for the HFE gene mutation C282Y comprise 85 to 90 percent of phenotypically affected persons. End-organ damage or clinical manifestations of hereditary hemochromatosis occur in approximately 10 percent of persons homozygous for C282Y. Symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis are nonspecific and typically absent in the early stages. If present, symptoms may include weakness, lethargy, arthralgias, and impotence. Later manifestations include arthralgias, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. Diagnosis requires confirmation of increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, with or without symptoms. Subtyping is based on genotypic expression. Serum ferritin measurement is the most useful prognostic indicator of disease severity. Liver biopsy is performed to stage the degree of fibrosis with severe ferritin elevation or transaminitis, or to diagnose nonclassical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with other genetic defects. Treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis requires phlebotomy, and the frequency is guided by serial measurements of serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. Iron avidity can result from overtreatment. If iron avidity is not suspected, it may mimic undertreatment with persistently elevated transferrin saturation. Dietary modification is generally unnecessary. Universal screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is not recommended, but testing should be performed in first-degree relatives of patients with classical HFE-related hemochromatosis, those with evidence of active liver disease, and patients with abnormal iron study results. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is reserved for those with hereditary hemochromatosis and cirrhosis.},

  abstract = {Tamoxifen (TAM), the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast cancer, induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic anemia. This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes, attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM-induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms. TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration. The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples, but 12.5 μM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions. Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis, TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes. The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of α-tocopherol (α-T) and α-tocopherol acetate (α-TAc) (inactivated functional hydroxyl) indicating that TAM-induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage. This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM-induced hemolysis. Furthermore, it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH, thus ruling out TAM-induced cell oxidative stress. Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K+ from the cells, also excluding a colloid-osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis, according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves. However, TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane-cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3. Either α-T or α-TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes. These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided. Therefore, TAM-induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane, leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane. These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM, resulting in hemolytic anemia. Additionally, since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity, the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action.},

  abstract = {Serum iron levels vary throughout the day. Morning levels are generally assumed to be higher than afternoon or evening levels. We studied whether our practice of restricting serum iron collections to the morning was necessary. Serum iron, iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels were determined on blood specimens obtained from 20 healthy adult volunteers at 8 AM, noon, and 4 PM (day 1) and 8 AM (day 2).

  abstract = {Background: Women may have incomplete understanding of a breast cancer diagnosis, leading to inaccurate reporting in epidemiological studies. However, it is not feasible to obtain consent for medical records from all women participating in a study. Therefore, it is important to determine how well self-reported breast cancer characteristics correspond with what is found in medical records, but few studies have evaluated agreement of self-reported breast cancer characteristics with abstracted medical records. Methods: We calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) of self-reports compared to medical records and explored whether participant characteristics may have influenced reporting accuracy. We analyzed data from 2518 reported breast cancer cases from the Sister Study, a large nationwide cohort of women with a family history of breast cancer. Results: Medical records or pathology reports were obtained for 2066 of 2518 (82\%) women who reported incident breast cancer. Breast cancer was confirmed for over 99\% (n = 2054) of women with medical records. Confirmation rates were high for invasive, ductal, hormone receptor positive, and HER2 negative breast cancers, with little variation by race/ethnicity or age. Self-reported in situ breast cancer had a lower PPV (64.2\%), with medical records showing invasive breast cancer instead, especially for older and Hispanic women. Hormone receptor (ER and PR) negative and HER2 positive self-reports had lower PPVs (83.0\%, 71.6\%, and 66.1\% respectively). Hispanic women and women ages 65 or older at diagnosis were less able to accurately report breast cancer stage, excluding stage I. Conclusions: Accuracy of reporting overall breast cancer and common subtypes is high. Despite having a family history of breast cancer and voluntarily enrolling in a study evaluating breast cancer risk factors, participants may have greater difficulty distinguishing between in situ and invasive breast cancer and may less accurately report other less common subtypes. Discrepancies may reflect women’s poor understanding of information conveyed by health care providers or lack of consistent terminology used to describe subtypes.},

  abstract = {Background/Objectives: Seasonal variation may reduce the validity of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) as a biomarker of vitamin D status. Here we aimed to identify potential determinants of seasonal variation in 25OHD concentrations and to evaluate cosinor modelling as a method to adjust single 25OHD measurements for seasonal variation. Subjects/Methods: In Caucasian cardiovascular patients (1999–2004), we measured 25OHD by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in 4116 baseline and 528 follow-up samples. To baseline values, we fitted a cosinor model for monthly concentrations of 25OHD. Using the model, we estimated each patient's adjusted annual 25OHD value. Further, we studied how covariates affected the annual mean 25OHD concentration and seasonal variation of the study cohort. To evaluate the model, we predicted follow-up measurements with and without covariates and compared accuracy with carrying forward baseline values and linear regression adjusting for season, common approaches in research and clinical practice, respectively. Results: The annual mean (59.6\,nmol/l) was associated with participants' age, gender, smoking status, body mass, physical activity level, diabetes diagnosis, vitamin D supplement use and study site (adjusted models, P{$<$}0.05). Seasonal 25OHD variation was 15.8\,nmol/l, and older age ({$>$}62 years) was associated with less variation (adjusted model, P=0.025). Prediction of follow-up measurements was more accurate with the cosinor model compared with the other approaches (P{$<$}0.05). Adding covariates to cosinor models did not improve prediction (P{$>$}0.05). Conclusions: We find cosinor models suitable and flexible for analysing and adjusting for seasonal variation in 25OHD concentrations, which is influenced by age.},

  abstract = {In statistics, Deming regression, named after W. Edwards Deming, is an errors-in-variables model which tries to find the line of best fit for a two-dimensional dataset. It differs from the simple linear regression in that it accounts for errors in observations on both the x- and the y- axis. It is a special case of total least squares, which allows for any number of predictors and a more complicated error structure. Deming regression is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimation of an errors-in-variables model in which the errors for the two variables are assumed to be independent and normally distributed, and the ratio of their variances, denoted δ, is known. In practice, this ratio might be estimated from related data-sources; however the regression procedure takes no account for possible errors in estimating this ratio. The Deming regression is only slightly more difficult to compute compared to the simple linear regression. Most statistical software packages used in clinical chemistry offer Deming regression. The model was originally introduced by Adcock (1878) who considered the case δ = 1, and then more generally by Kummell (1879) with arbitrary δ.  However their ideas remained largely unnoticed for more than 50 years, until they were revived by Koopmans (1937) and later propagated even more by Deming (1943).  The latter book became so popular in clinical chemistry and related fields that the method was even dubbed Deming regression in those fields.},

However, epidemiological evidence is lacking. Thus, we investigated the association between dietary iron intake and breast cancer risk, and its potential modulation by an antioxidant supplementation and lipid intake. This prospective study included 4646 women from the SU. VI. MAX trial (daily lowdose antioxidants vs. placebo). 188 incident breast cancers were diagnosed (median follow-up= 12.6y). Dietary iron intake was assessed using repeated 24h dietary records. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were computed. Dietary iron intake was associated with an increased breast cancer risk (HRT3vs. T1= 1.67 (1.022.71), P-trend= 0.04). This association was observed in the placebo group (HRT3vs. (T1)= 2.80 (1.42-5.54), P-trend= 0.003), but not in the antioxidant-supplemented group (P-trend= 0.7, P-interaction= 0.1). Besides, in the placebo group, the increased breast cancer risk associated with dietary iron intake was more specifically observed in women with higher lipid intake (P-trend= 0.046). These findings suggest that dietary iron intake may be associated with an increased breast cancer risk, especially in women who did not received antioxidants during the trial and who consumed more lipids. This supports the experimental results suggesting that breast cancer risk may be increased by iron-induced lipid peroxidation.},

  abstract = {Patients with inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high rates of iron deficiency with adverse clinical consequences. Under normal circumstances, serum ferritin levels are a sensitive marker for iron status but ferritin is an acute-phase reactant that becomes elevated in response to inflammation, complicating the diagnosis. Proinflammatory cytokines also trigger an increase in hepcidin, which restricts uptake of dietary iron and promotes sequestration of iron by ferritin within storage sites. Patients with inflammatory conditions may thus have restricted availability of iron for erythropoiesis and other cell functions due to increased hepcidin expression, despite normal or high levels of serum ferritin. The standard threshold for iron deficiency ({$<$}30 μg/L) therefore does not apply and transferrin saturation (TSAT), a marker of iron availability, should also be assessed. A serum ferritin threshold of {$<$}100 μg/L or TSAT {$<$} 20\% can be considered diagnostic for iron deficiency in CHF, CKD, and IBD. If serum ferritin is 100–300 μg/L, TSAT {$<$} 20\% is required to confirm iron deficiency. Routine surveillance of serum ferritin and TSAT in these at-risk groups is advisable so that iron deficiency can be detected and managed.},

  abstract = {Patients with inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic heart failure (CHF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high rates of iron deficiency with adverse clinical consequences. Under normal circumstances, serum ferritin levels are a sensitive marker for iron status but ferritin is an acute-phase reactant that becomes elevated in response to inflammation, complicating the diagnosis. Proinflammatory cytokines also trigger an increase in hepcidin, which restricts uptake of dietary iron and promotes sequestration of iron by ferritin within storage sites. Patients with inflammatory conditions may thus have restricted availability of iron for erythropoiesis and other cell functions due to increased hepcidin expression, despite normal or high levels of serum ferritin. The standard threshold for iron deficiency ({$<$}30 μg/L) therefore does not apply and transferrin saturation (TSAT), a marker of iron availability, should also be assessed. A serum ferritin threshold of {$<$}100 μg/L or TSAT {$<$} 20\% can be considered diagnostic for iron deficiency in CHF, CKD, and IBD. If serum ferritin is 100–300 μg/L, TSAT {$<$} 20\% is required to confirm iron deficiency. Routine surveillance of serum ferritin and TSAT in these at-risk groups is advisable so that iron deficiency can be detected and managed.},

If a meta-analysis is simply updated with additional data, then the resulting 95\% CI will be wrong because it will not have accounted for the fact that the earlier meta-analysis failed or succeeded to exclude the null. This situation can be avoided by using the likelihood ratio (LR) as a measure of evidence that does not depend on type-1 error. We show how an LR-based approach, first advanced by Goodman, can be used in a meta-analysis to pool data from separate studies to quantitatively assess where the total evidence points. The method works by estimating the log-likelihood ratio (LogLR) function from each study. Those functions are then summed to obtain a combined function, which is then used to retrieve the total effect estimate, and a corresponding ‘intrinsic’ confidence interval. Using as illustrations the CAPRIE trial of clopidogrel versus aspirin in the prevention of ischaemic events, and our own meta-analyses of higher potency statins and the risk of acute kidney injury, we show that the LR-based method yields the same point estimate as a traditional analysis, but with an intrinsic confidence interval that is appropriately wider than the traditional 95\% CI. The LR-based method can be used to conduct both fixed effect and random effects meta-analyses, it can be applied to old and new meta-analyses alike, and results can be presented in a format that is familiar to a meta-analytic audience.},

  abstract = {Iron is an essential nutrient that facilitates cell proliferation and growth. Iron can be detrimental, however. The ability of iron to cycle between oxidized and reduced forms contributes to the formation of free radicals. An excess of free radicals leads to lipid peroxidation, more reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, damage to DNA and other biomolecules, and, if potentially, tumorigenesis. Iron also has a role in the maintenance of the tumor microenvironment and in metastasis. Pathways of iron acquisition, efflux, storage, and regulation are all perturbed in cancer, suggesting that reprogramming of iron metabolism is a central aspect of tumor cell survival. Recent studies have shed light on the role of iron metabolism in cancer stem cells (CSC) and suggest that specific targeting of iron metabolism in CSCs may improve the efficacy of cancer therapy. In this review, we first summarize briefly our current understanding of the intracellular processes involving iron, the effect of dietary iron, and its relation to cancer. We emphasize the importance of modifier “iron genes” in cancer and the possibility that these genes may encode biomarkers that may be used clinically. We then provide an update on the role of iron in metabolic reprogramming, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the regulation of epigenetic marks essential for CSC maintenance and plasticity. Finally, we discuss the potential of targeting a recently discovered form of iron-regulated cell death, ferroptosis, in CSCs for treatment of cancer.},

  abstract = {Background Low serum ferritin levels signify low iron stores and this could predispose to iron deficiency anemia. Objective To determine the rate and predictors of low serum ferritin levels during the puerperium in Enugu, Southeast Nigeria. Study design A hospital-based prospective longitudinal study involving parturient women who delivered singleton fetuses at term. Venous blood samples were collected to determine the serum ferritin concentration at 48 hours and 6 weeks postpartum. Data analysis involved descriptive and inferential statistics at 95\% confidence interval (CI) using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) computer software version 20.0. Results Two-hundred and two women who carried singleton pregnancies to term were studied. The mean serum ferritin levels at 48 hours and 6 weeks were 27.82±18.41 µg/L and 36.12±21.53 µg/L, respectively. Forty-eight hours postdelivery, 29.2\% had low ferritin levels and this decreased to 12.4\% at 6 weeks postpartum. There was a significant positive correlation between the serum ferritin level at 48 hours postdelivery and the serum ferritin level at 6 weeks postpartum (r=0.89, P{$<$}0.001). Predictors of the low ferritin level at 6 weeks included age {$<$}20 years (odds ratio [OR] =0.70, 95\% CI =0.53, 0.93), multiparity (OR =63.7, 95\% CI =3.18, 127.5), anemia at 48 hours postpartum (OR =61.7, 95\% CI =13.27, 116.6), a low ferritin level at 48 hours (OR =78.1, 95\% CI =8.8, 108.3), and intake of antenatal hematinics for {$<$}3 months (OR =0.04, 95\% CI =0.01, 0.20). Conclusion There was a significant occurrence of low ferritin levels during the puerperium in the study centers, and this was associated mainly with pregnancy and delivery factors. Efforts to improve the iron stores in parturient women could benefit from early booking and compliance with antenatal hematinics and optimizing hemoglobin and iron levels before delivery.},

Serum ferritin levels are increased in PCOS, especially when glucose tolerance is abnormal, suggesting mild iron overload. Factors contributing to potential iron overload in PCOS include the iron sparing effect of chronic menstrual dysfunction, insulin resistance, and a decrease in hepcidin leading to increased iron absorption. Enhancement of erythropoiesis by androgen excess is unlikely, because soluble transferrin receptor levels are not increased in PCOS. Future venues of research should address the long-term effects of PCOS treatment on iron overload and, conversely, the possible effects of iron lowering strategies on the glucose tolerance of patients with PCOS.},

Iron binding capacity is of two types, TIBC and unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC). When iron stores are depleted, the transferrin levels increase in the blood. As only one-third of transferrin is saturated with iron, so the transferrin present in serum has an extra binding capacity (67\%). This is unsaturated iron-binding capacity. TIBC is the total of serum iron and UIBC. Percentage transferrin saturation is calculated by dividing serum iron by TIBC and multiplying the result by 100.},

  abstract = {The breast is particularly vulnerable to carcinogenic influences during adolescence due to rapid proliferation of mammary cells and lack of terminal differentiation. We investigated consumption of adolescent red meat and other protein sources in relation to breast cancer risk in the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. We followed prospectively 44,231 women aged 33-52 years who, in 1998, completed a detailed questionnaire about diet during adolescence. Relative risks (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. We documented 1132 breast cancer cases during 13-year follow-up. In multivariable Cox regression models with major breast cancer risk factors adjustment, greater consumption of total red meat in adolescence was significantly associated with higher premenopausal breast cancer risk (highest vs. lowest quintiles, RR, 1.43; 95\%CI, 1.05-1.94; P-trend=0.007), but not postmenopausal breast cancer. Adolescent intake of poultry was associated with lower risk of breast cancer overall (RR, 0.76; 95\%CI, 0.60-0.97; for each serving/day). Adolescent intakes of iron, heme iron, fish, eggs, legumes and nuts were not associated with breast cancer. Replacement of one serving/day of total red meat with one serving of combination of poultry, fish, legumes, and nuts was associated with a 15\% lower risk of breast cancer overall (RR, 0.85; 95\%CI, 0.74-0.96) and a 23\% lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer (RR, 0.77; 95\%CI, 0.64-0.92). In conclusion, higher consumption of red meat during adolescence was associated with premenopausal breast cancer. Substituting other dietary protein sources for red meat in adolescent diet may decrease premenopausal breast cancer risk.},

Main outcome measure Incident cases of invasive breast carcinoma, identified through self report and confirmed by pathology report. Results We documented 2830 cases of breast cancer during 20 years of follow-up. Higher intake of total red meat was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer overall (relative risk 1.22, 95\% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.40; P-trend=0.01, for highest fifth v lowest fifth of intake). However, higher intakes of poultry, fish, eggs, legumes, and nuts were not related to breast cancer overall. When the association was evaluated by menopausal status, higher intake of poultry was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women (0.73, 0.58 to 0.91; P-trend=0.02, for highest fifth v lowest fifth of intake) but not in premenopausal women (0.93, 0.78 to 1.11; P-trend=0.60, for highest fifth v lowest fifth of intake). In estimating the effects of exchanging different protein sources, substituting one serving/day of legumes for one serving/day of red meat was associated with a 15\% lower risk of breast cancer among all women (0.85, 0.73 to 0.98) and a 19\% lower risk among premenopausal women (0.81, 0.66 to 0.99). Also, substituting one serving/day of poultry for one serving/day of red meat was associated with a 17\% lower risk of breast cancer overall (0.83, 0.72 to 0.96) and a 24\% lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (0.76, 0.59 to 0.99). Furthermore, substituting one serving/day of combined legumes, nuts, poultry, and fish for one serving/day of red meat was associated with a 14\% lower risk of breast cancer overall (0.86, 0.78 to 0.94) and premenopausal breast cancer (0.86, 0.76 to 0.98). Conclusion Higher red meat intake in early adulthood may be a risk factor for breast cancer, and replacing red meat with a combination of legumes, poultry, nuts and fish may reduce the risk of breast cancer.},

  abstract = {The coefficient of variation is often used as a guide of the repeatability of measurements in clinical trials and other medical work. When possible, one makes repeated measurements on a set of individuals to calculate the relative variability of the test with the understanding that a reliable clinical test should give similar results when repeated on the same patient. There are times, however, when repeated measurements on the same patient are not possible. Under these circumstances, to combine results from different clinical trials or test sites, it is necessary to compare the coefficients of variation of several clinical trials. Using the work of Miller, we develop a general statistic for testing the hypothesis that the coefficients of variation are the same for k populations, with unequal sample sizes. This statistic is invariant under the choice of the order of the populations, and is asymptotically χ2. We provide an example using data from Yang and HayGlass. We compare the size and the power of the test to that of Bennett, Doornbos and Dijkstra and a statistic based on Hedges and Olkin.},

Aspirin use lowers risk of MI, probably through antithrombotic and antiinflammatory effects. Because serum ferritin (SF) can be elevated spuriously by inflammation, reported associations between elevated SF. used as an indicator of iron stores, and heart disease could be confounded by occult inflammation and aspirin use if they affect SF independently of iron status. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that aspirin use is associated with reduced SF. Design: We used analysis of covariance to investigate the relation between SF and categories of aspirin use in 913 elderly participants aged 67-96 y in the Framingham Heart Study. Results: After adjustment for sex, age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use. concentrations of C-reactive protein and liver enzymes, white blood cell count, and use of nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and other medications, subjects who took {$>$}7 aspirins/wk had a significantly lower (by 25\%) geometric mean SF than did nonusers, who took {$<$} 1 aspirin/wk (71 compared with 95 mug/L, respectively, P for trend = 0.004). This effect of aspirin on SF was more marked in diseased subjects than in healthy subjects (mean SF was 50\% lower compared with 21\% lower. respectively). Conclusions: Aspirin use is associated with lower SF. We suggest this effect results from possible increased occult blood loss and a cytokine-mediated effect on SF in subjects with inflammation, infection, or liver disease. The relations between aspirin, inflammation, and SF may confound epidemiologic associations between elevated SF, as an indicator of iron stores, and heart disease risk.},

The suitability of using small plasma samples spotted and dried on filter paper for measurements of plasma ferritin and transferrin receptor was evaluated in the present study. METHODS: Blood specimens obtained from 73 male and 83 female subjects (19-40 years) representing a wide range of iron status were used to perform parallel measurements of plasma ferritin and transferrin receptor on whole plasma and spotted plasma samples. RESULTS: Ratio plots, evaluating the acceptability and precision of the spot method in ferritin and transferrin receptor assays, showed the expected proportion of data points within the 95\% prediction interval. In the composite group of 156 subjects, both the whole plasma and plasma spot methods gave a geometric mean transferrin receptor/ferritin ratio of 18. The regression equation for the ratio was logy = 1.045 logx - 0.05126; r = 0.986; P {$<$}0.0001. The ratio of transferrin receptor/ferritin determined from plasma spots correctly identified all 12 subjects with iron deficiency anemia compared with 11 of the 12 for whole plasma measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of ferritin and transferrin receptor on plasma spotted and dried on filter paper are comparable to whole plasma values for the identification of iron deficiency anemia. The use of dried plasma spots will facilitate the collection, storage, and transport of samples in epidemiological studies of anemia prevalence.},

Validation studies, in which an investigator compares the accuracy of a measure with a gold standard measure, are an important way to understand and mitigate this bias. More attention is being paid to the importance of validation studies in recent years, yet they remain rare in epidemiologic research and, in our experience, they remain poorly understood. Many epidemiologists have not had any experience with validations studies, either in the classroom or in their work. We present an example of misclassification of a dichotomous exposure to elucidate some important misunderstandings about how to conduct validation studies to generate valid information. We demonstrate that careful attention to the design of validation studies is central to determining how the bias parameters (e.g. sensitivity and specificity or positive and negative predictive values) can be used in quantitative bias analyses to appropriately correct for misclassification. Whether sampling is done based on the true gold standard measure, the misclassified measure or at random will determine which parameters are valid and the precision of those estimates. Whether or not the validation is done stratified by other key variables (e.g. by the exposure) will also determine the validity of those estimates. We also present sample questions that can be used to teach these concepts. Increasing the presence of validation studies in the classroom could have a positive impact on their use and improve the validity of estimates of effect in epidemiologic research.},

  abstract = {This paper summarizes and confronts the relationships between six well-known regressions applied in the context of measurement methods comparison with or without replicated data. When two measurement methods are equivalent, it can be expected that there is no analytical bias between them and they must provide the same results on average notwithstanding the measurement errors. Usually, there is no golden-standard (like a calibration problem) and each measurement method is compared to another one and vice-versa with a linear regression analysis. If there is no bias, the results should not be far from the identity line Y=X. Unfortunately, the measurement errors in each axis must be taken into account in the regression analysis (and ideally the switching of axes) by applying a linear errors-in-variables regression. Therefore, the OLS (Ordinary Least Square) regression lines provide biased estimated lines while the errors-in-variables regressions lines lie between the two extreme OLS lines. DR (Deming Regression) and BLS (Bivariate Least Square) regressions are the most general regressions and provide (asymptotically) unbiased estimated lines which are confounded under homoscedasticity. The biases and coverage probabilities of the six regressions are compared with simulations where the results are displayed in charts instead of large data sets. As the precision ratio λ of two measurement methods is a very important parameter in errors-in-variables regressions, it will be a leitmotiv in this paper and all the charts will be linked to it. An unbiased estimator of λ is also given. The approximate CI (Confidence Intervals) provided by BLS are very easy to compute and provide coverage probabilities close to the nominal level. On the other hand, the CI provided by DR are less easy to compute but provide better coverage probabilities whatever λ for large sample sizes (N{$>$}20). Finally, the regression techniques are applied with real data and this paper proposes to plot all the possible values of the estimated parameters and their CI in a chart with respect to λ. Then, the equivalence hypothesis can sometimes be rejected (or not rejected) whatever λ. This is very useful when λ is unknown and inestimable because of no replicated data.},

  abstract = {Systemic iron overload (SIO) is a common challenge in patients with hematological diseases and develops as a result of ineffective erythropoiesis, multiple red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and disease-specific therapies. Iron homeostasis is tightly regulated as there is no physiological pathway to excrete iron from the body. Excess iron is, therefore, stored in tissues like liver, heart and bone marrow and can lead to progressive organ damage. The presence of free iron in the form of non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) is especially detrimental. Reactive oxygen species can also cause stromal damage in the bone marrow and promote leukemic cell growth in vitro. In acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes outcome is worse in patients with SIO compared to patients without. Especially in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT presence of NTBI before or during transplant has been shown to negatively affect non-relapse mortality and overall survival. Although the mechanisms, of how these effects are mediated by SIO are not very well understood monitoring of iron status by serum markers and imaging techniques is, therefore, mandatory especially in these patients. Whether peri-interventional iron chelation may improve outcome of these patients is part of current clinical research.},

When correlations exist between independent variables, as is generally the case with ecological datasets, this procedure leads to biased parameter estimates. Standard multiple regression, by contrast, yields unbiased parameter estimates. 3. In multiple regression parameters are estimated controlling for the effects of the other variables in the model, and thus multiple regression achieves what residual regression claims to do. 4. Several measures of correlation exist that differ in the way that variance is partitioned among independent variables. These can be estimated multiply, or sequentially if reasons exist for estimating effects of variables in a hierarchical manner.},

  abstract = {Vitamin D measurements are influenced by seasonal variation and specific assay used. Motivated by multicenter studies of associations of vitamin D with cancer, we formulated an analytic framework for matched case-control data that accounts for seasonal variation and calibrates to a reference assay. Calibration data were obtained from controls sampled within decile strata of the uncalibrated vitamin D values. Seasonal sine-cosine series were fit to control data. Practical findings included the following: (1) failure to adjust for season and calibrate increased variance, bias, and mean square error and (2) analysis of continuous vitamin D requires a variance adjustment for variation in the calibration estimate. An advantage of the continuous linear risk model is that results are independent of the reference date for seasonal adjustment. (3) For categorical risk models, procedures based on categorizing the seasonally adjusted and calibrated vitamin D have near nominal operating characteristics; estimates of log odds ratios are not robust to choice of seasonal reference date, however. Thus, public health recommendations based on categories of vitamin D should also define the time of year to which they refer. This work supports the use of simple methods for calibration and seasonal adjustment and is informing analytic approaches for the multicenter Vitamin D Pooling Project for Breast and Colorectal Cancer.

Although pre-diagnostic concentrations of these biomarkers, especially C-reactive protein, have been associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer in some studies, this association does not seem to have a robust support without hints of bias. Future prospective studies should evaluate multiple inflammatory biomarkers with longitudinal measures over the follow-up taking advantage of new multiplex cytokine quantification arrays and use more sophisticated joint or biomarker pattern statistical approaches to capture the complex and dynamic interplay between biomarkers and risk of colorectal cancer.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test of iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases (10 June 2020): DARE (Cochrane Library) Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA (Cochrane Library) Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) Issue 6 of 12 2020, MEDLINE (OVID) 1946 to 9 June 2020, Embase (OVID) 1947 to week 23 2020, CINAHL (Ebsco) 1982 to June 2020, Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp \& CPCI-SSH to June 2020, POPLINE 16/8/18, Open Grey (10/6/20), TRoPHI (10/6/20), Bibliomap (10/6/20), IBECS (10/6/20), SCIELO (10/6/20), Global Index Medicus (10/6/20) AIM, IMSEAR, WPRIM, IMEMR, LILACS (10/6/20), PAHO (10/6/20), WHOLIS 10/6/20, IndMED (16/8/18) and Native Health Research Database (10/6/20). We also searched two trials registers and contacted relevant organisations for unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all study designs seeking to evaluate serum or plasma ferritin concentrations measured by any current or previously available quantitative assay as an index of iron status in individuals of any age, sex, clinical and physiological status from any country. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We followed standard Cochrane methods. We designed the data extraction form to record results for ferritin concentration as the index test, and bone marrow iron content for iron deficiency and liver iron content for iron overload as the reference standards. Two other authors further extracted and validated the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative cases, and extracted or derived the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for each threshold presented for iron deficiency and iron overload in included studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. We used GRADE assessment to enable the quality of evidence and hence strength of evidence for our conclusions. MAIN RESULTS: Our search was conducted initially in 2014 and updated in 2017, 2018 and 2020 (10 June). We identified 21,217 records and screened 14,244 records after duplicates were removed. We assessed 316 records in full text. We excluded 190 studies (193 records) with reasons and included 108 studies (111 records) in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. There were 11 studies (12 records) that we screened from the last search update and appeared eligible for a future analysis. We decided to enter these as awaiting classification. We stratified the analysis first by participant clinical status: apparently healthy and non-healthy populations. We then stratified by age and pregnancy status as: infants and children, adolescents, pregnant women, and adults. Iron deficiency We included 72 studies (75 records) involving 6059 participants. Apparently healthy populations Five studies screened for iron deficiency in people without apparent illness. In the general adult population, three studies reported sensitivities of 63\% to 100\% at the optimum cutoff for ferritin, with corresponding specificities of 92\% to 98\%, but the ferritin cutoffs varied between studies. One study in healthy children reported a sensitivity of 74\% and a specificity of 77\%. One study in pregnant women reported a sensitivity of 88\% and a specificity of 100\%. Overall confidence in these estimates was very low because of potential bias, indirectness, and sparse and heterogenous evidence. No studies screened for iron overload in apparently healthy people. People presenting for medical care There were 63 studies among adults presenting for medical care (5042 participants). For a sample of 1000 subjects with a 35\% prevalence of iron deficiency (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 85\% specificity, there would be 315 iron-deficient subjects correctly classified as having iron deficiency and 35 iron-deficient subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron deficiency, leading to a 90\% sensitivity. Thresholds proposed by the authors of the included studies ranged between 12 to 200 µg/L. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 50. Among non-healthy adults using a fixed threshold of 30 μg/L (nine studies, 512 participants, low-certainty evidence), the pooled estimate for sensitivity was 79\% with a 95\% confidence interval of (58\%, 91\%) and specificity of 98\%, with a 95\% confidence interval of (91\%, 100\%). The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 140, a relatively highly informative test. Iron overload We included 36 studies (36 records) involving 1927 participants. All studies concerned non-healthy populations. There were no studies targeting either infants, children, or pregnant women. Among all populations (one threshold for males and females; 36 studies, 1927 participants, very low-certainty evidence): for a sample of 1000 subjects with a 42\% prevalence of iron overload (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 65\% specificity, there would be 332 iron-overloaded subjects correctly classified as having iron overload and 85 iron-overloaded subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron overload, leading to a 80\% sensitivity. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 8. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: At a threshold of 30 micrograms/L, there is low-certainty evidence that blood ferritin concentration is reasonably sensitive and a very specific test for iron deficiency in people presenting for medical care. There is very low certainty that high concentrations of ferritin provide a sensitive test for iron overload in people where this condition is suspected. There is insufficient evidence to know whether ferritin concentration performs similarly when screening asymptomatic people for iron deficiency or overload.},

  abstract = {Understanding the overall progression of neurodegenerative diseases is critical to the timing of therapeutic interventions and design of effective clinical trials. Disease progression can be assessed with longitudinal study designs in which outcomes are measured repeatedly over time and are assessed with respect to risk factors, either measured repeatedly or at baseline. Longitudinal data allows researchers to assess temporal disease aspects, but the analysis is complicated by complex correlation structures, irregularly spaced visits, missing data, and mixtures of time-varying and static covariate effects. We review modern statistical methods designed for these challenges. Among all methods, the mixed effect model most flexibly accommodates the challenges and is preferred by the FDA for observational and clinical studies. Examples from Huntington’s disease studies are used for clarification, but the methods apply to neurodegenerative diseases in general, particularly as the identification of prodromal forms of neurodegenerative disease through sensitive biomarkers is increasing.},

Correlations for other elements ranged from 0.26 (copper) to 0.58 (zinc). In utilizing biomarkers to assess exposure in epidemiological studies of cancer and other chronic disease, random within-person variability in exposure leads to attenuation of measures of association between exposure and disease. We demonstrate the effect of such variability on odds ratios from a hypothetical case-control study. For a true odds ratio of 3.0 (for a comparison of the highest quintile versus the remaining 4 quintiles of exposure) the odds ratios which would be observed in the presence of the degree of within-person variability demonstrated in this study were 2.15 for toenail arsenic and 1.67 for toenail copper levels. Toenail concentrations of certain trace elements are useful biomarkers of exposure in which a single sample is assumed to represent long-term exposure. However, substantial attenuation in measures of association may occur.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of heme, non-heme and iron supplementation on iron stores in healthy elderly men and women. Method: We conducted a 10 year longitudinal study (48 men and 77 women) and a one year cross-sectional study (165 men and 226 women) in healthy elderly men and women enrolled in the New Mexico Aging Process Study. Iron stores were estimated by serum ferritin concentrations and iron intake was determined by three-day food records in the longitudinal study and by a food frequency questionnaire in the cross-sectional study. Results: We found no association between heme iron intake and iron stores in either the longitudinal or cross sectional study. In the cross-sectional study we found in women, but not in men, that age and supplemental iron intake were significantly and positively associated with increased iron stores. Conclusion: Iron stores in elderly men are thought to reach steady state levels where iron absorption is adjusted to a level just sufficient to cover basal iron losses. In elderly women, we speculate that not enough time has elapsed for postmenopausal women to reach steady state levels of iron stores resulting in increases in iron absorption with age. Another factor is that use of hormone replacement therapy could further delay some women in reaching steady state iron levels due to continued menstrual blood losses.},

  abstract = {Background Overt bleeding associated with low dose aspirin (LDA) is well-recognized, little attention is given to the possibility of association between LDA and occult bleeding, although this is known to occur in healthy volunteers. LDA is used increasingly in primary and secondary prevention of a number of medical conditions, many of which are common in older people, as is anemia. Anemia in older people is associated with adverse outcomes including disability, morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to review the evidence that LDA might cause anemia without overt bleeding. Methods An extensive narrative review was carried out. Electronic searching (including database links) and reference lists of reports were used to identify studies reporting on use of aspirin ≤325 mg/day and anemia or change in hemoglobin (Hb) without overt bleeding. Data were extracted from reports of trials, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and prevalence studies of adults aged ≥18 years, published since 1980. Results There are few relevant data, with considerable heterogeneity among trial designs, duration, and patient characteristics in studies of LDA. In five randomised trials (n = 5879) in (mostly secondary) prevention, the majority of patients were men without peptic ulcer disease aged 50-70 years and no consistent association between LDA and change in Hb was found. In two smaller studies (n = 609) of primary prevention in healthy patients aged ≥70 years, there was a small but statistically significant fall in Hb with LDA. Observational studies, and data from trials in which use of LDA was not a primary focus of the study, were inconclusive. Conclusions It is not clear whether there is an association between LDA and anemia in the absence of overt bleeding, but there may be an association between LDA and fall in Hb in (a subset of) older patients. The available evidence has significant limitations, which are discussed; studies including more older patients, and publication of individual patient data, would help clarify this important matter.},

  abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (hereafter, factor analysis) is a complex statistical method that is integral to many fields of research. Using factor analysis requires researchers to make several decisions, each of which affects the solutions generated. In this paper, we focus on five major decisions that are made in conducting factor analysis: (i) establishing how large the sample needs to be, (ii) choosing between factor analysis and principal components analysis, (iii) determining the number of factors to retain, (iv) selecting a method of data extraction, and (v) deciding upon the methods of factor rotation. The purpose of this paper is threefold: (i) to review the literature with respect to these five decisions, (ii) to assess current practices in nursing research, and (iii) to offer recommendations for future use. The literature reviews illustrate that factor analysis remains a dynamic field of study, with recent research having practical implications for those who use this statistical method. The assessment was conducted on 54 factor analysis (and principal components analysis) solutions presented in the results sections of 28 papers published in the 2012 volumes of the 10 highest ranked nursing journals, based on their 5-year impact factors. The main findings from the assessment were that researchers commonly used (a) participants-toitems ratios for determining sample sizes (used for 43\% of solutions), (b) principal components analysis (61\%) rather than factor analysis (39\%), (c) the eigenvalues greater than one rule and scree tests to decide upon the numbers of factors/components to retain (61\% and 46\%, respectively), (d) principal components analysis and unweighted least squares as methods of data extraction (61\% and 19\%, respectively), and (e) the Varimax method of rotation (44\%). In general, well-established, but out-dated, heuristics and practices informed decision making with respect to the performance of factor analysis in nursing studies. Based on the findings from factor analysis research, it seems likely that the use of such methods may have had a material, adverse effect on the solutions generated. We offer recommendations for future practice with respect to each of the five decisions discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Objective: Survival time is an important type of outcome variable in treatment research. Currently, limited guidance is available regarding performing mediation analyses with survival outcomes, which generally do not have normally distributed errors, and contain unobserved (censored) events. We present considerations for choosing an approach, using a comparison of semi-parametric proportional hazards (PH) and fully parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) approaches for illustration. Method: We compare PH and AFT models and procedures in their integration into mediation models and review their ability to produce coefficients that estimate causal effects. Using simulation studies modeling Weibull-distributed survival times, we compare statistical properties of mediation analyses incorporating PH and AFT approaches (employing SAS procedures PHREG and LIFEREG, respectively) under varied data conditions, some including censoring. A simulated data set illustrates the findings. Results: AFT models integrate more easily than PH models into mediation models. Furthermore, mediation analyses incorporating LIFEREG produce coefficients that can estimate causal effects, and demonstrate superior statistical properties. Censoring introduces bias in the coefficient estimate representing the treatment effect on outcome – underestimation in LIFEREG, and overestimation in PHREG. With LIFEREG, this bias can be addressed using an alternative estimate obtained from combining other coefficients, whereas this is not possible with PHREG. Conclusions: When Weibull assumptions are not violated, there are compelling advantages to using LIFEREG over PHREG for mediation analyses involving survival-time outcomes. Irrespective of the procedures used, the interpretation of coefficients, effects of censoring on coefficient estimates, and statistical properties should be taken into account when reporting results.},

  abstract = {Iron is an essential micronutrient for nearly all living organisms. In addition to facilitating redox reactions, iron is bound by metalloproteins that participate in a variety of biological processes. As the bioavailability of free iron in host environments is extremely low, iron lies at the center of a battle for nutrients between microbes and their host. Mucosal surfaces such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are constantly exposed to commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. Whereas a key strategy of mammalian antimicrobial defense is to deprive microbes of iron, pathogens and some commensals have evolved effective strategies to circumvent iron limitation. Here we provide an overview of mechanisms underpinning the tug-of-war for iron between microbes and their host, with a particular focus on mucosal surfaces.},

  abstract = {In a contemporary clinical laboratory it is very common to have to assess the agreement between two quantitative methods of measurement. The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods. In 1983 Altman and Bland (B\&A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement. The B\&A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95\% of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot. The B\&A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals. The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},

A lack of association is usually established by demonstrating a non-significant relationship with a traditional test (e.g., Pearson's r). However, for logical as well as statistical reasons, such conclusions are problematic. In this paper, we discuss and compare the empirical Type I error and power rates of three lack of association tests. The results indicate that large, sometimes very large, sample sizes are required for the test statistics to be appropriate. What is especially problematic is that the required sample sizes may exceed what is practically feasible for the conditions that are expected to be common among researchers in psychology. This paper highlights the importance of using available lack of association tests, instead of traditional tests of association, for demonstrating the independence of variables, and qualifies the conditions under which these tests are appropriate.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron is required for the proliferation of cancer cells, and its depletion suppresses tumor growth. Eribulin mesylate (eribulin), a non-taxane microtubule inhibitor, disrupts the tumor microenvironment via vascular remodeling and obstruction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Herein, we investigated the effects of the iron chelator on tumor-related properties of breast cancer cells and the effects of iron chelator plus eribulin on tumor growth in vivo. METHODS: Two triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549, and one hormone-receptor positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, were used in our study. Cell proliferation, cell migration, cell cycle position, and gene expression were analyzed via MTT assays, wound-healing assays, flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. For the in vivo experiments, mice with breast cancer xenografts were treated with the inhibitors, alone or together, and tumor volume was determined. RESULTS: Iron chelator inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and decreased the proportion of S-phase cells. Conversely, it induced hypoxia, angiogenesis, EMT, and immune checkpoints, as determined by quantifying the expression of marker mRNAs in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Eribulin suppressed the expression of the hypoxia and EMT related marker mRNAs in the presence of iron chelator. Iron chelator plus eribulin inhibited tumor growth in vivo to a greater extent than did either inhibitor alone. CONCLUSIONS: Although iron chelator induces oncogenic events (hypoxia, angiogenesis, EMT, and immune checkpoints), it may be an effective treatment for breast cancer when administered in combination with eribulin.},

Associations of Ionizing Radiation and Breast Cancer-Related Serum Hormone and Growth Factor Levels in Cancer-Free Female A-Bomb Survivors. Radiat. Res. 176, 678-687 (2011). Levels of exposure to ionizing radiation are increasing for women worldwide due to the widespread use of CT and other radiologic diagnostic modalities. Exposure to ionizing radiation as well as increased levels of estradiol and other sex hormones are acknowledged breast cancer risk factors, but the effects of whole-body radiation on serum hormone levels in cancer-free women are unknown. This study examined whether ionizing radiation exposure is associated with levels of serum hormones and other markers that may mediate radiation-associated breast cancer risk. Serum samples were measured from cancer-free women who attended biennial health examinations with a wide range of past radiation exposure levels (N = 412, ages 26-79). The women were selected as controls for separate case-control studies from a cohort of A-bomb survivors. Outcome measures included serum levels of total estradiol, bioavailable estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, prolactin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), and ferritin. Relationships were assessed using repeated-measures regression models fitted with generalized estimating equations. Geometric mean serum levels of total estradiol and bioavailable estradiol increased with 1 Gy of radiation dose among samples collected from postmenopausal women (17\%(1Gy), 95\% CI: 1\%-36\% and 21\%(1Gy), 95\% CI: 4\%-40\%, respectively), while they decreased in samples collected from premenopausal women (-11\%(1Gy), 95\% CI: -20\%-1\% and -12\%(1Gy), 95\% CI: -20\%- -2\%, respectively). Interactions by menopausal status were significant (P = 0.003 and P {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Testosterone levels increased with radiation dose in postmenopausal samples (30.0\%(1Gy), 95\% CI: 13\%-49\%) while they marginally decreased in premenopausal samples (-10\%(1Gy), 95\% CI: -19\%-0\%) and the interaction by menopausal status was significant (P {$<$} 0.001). Serum levels of IGF1 increased linearly with radiation dose (11\%(1Gy), 95\% CI: 2\%-18\%) and there was a significant interaction by menopausal status (P = 0.014). Radiation-associated changes in serum levels of estradiol, bioavailable estradiol, testosterone and IGF1 were modified by menopausal status at the time of collection. No associations with radiation were observed in serum levels of progesterone, prolactin, IGFBP-3 or ferritin. (C) 2011 by Radiation Research Society},

Recent findings Biomarkers with skewed distributions should be transformed before they are included as continuous covariates in logistic regression models. The utility of new biomarkers may be assessed by measuring the improvement in predicting event risk after adding the biomarkers to an existing model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (C-statistic) is often cited; it was developed for a different purpose, however, and may not address the clinically relevant questions. Measures of risk reclassification and risk prediction accuracy may be more appropriate. Summary The appropriate analysis of biomarkers depends on the research question. Odds ratios obtained from logistic regression describe associations of biomarkers with clinical events; failure to accurately transform the markers, however, may result in misleading estimates. Whilst the C-statistic is often used to assess the ability of new biomarkers to improve the prediction of event risk, other measures may be more suitable.},

  abstract = {Background \& aims Marine-derived omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), lower circulating levels of triacylglycerols (TAGs), and the plant-derived omega-6 (n-6) PUFA linoleic acid (LA) may reduce cholesterol levels. Clinical studies on effects of these dietary or supplemental PUFAs on other blood fat fractions are few and have shown conflicting results. This study aimed to determine effects of high-dose supplemental n-3 (EPA~+~DHA) and n-6 (LA) PUFAs from high-quality oils on circulating lipoprotein subfractions and standard lipids (primary outcomes), as well as apolipoproteins, fatty acids, and glycemic control (secondary outcomes), in females and males with abdominal obesity. Methods This was a randomized double-blind crossover study with two 7-wk intervention periods separated by a 9-wk washout phase. Females (n~=~16) were supplemented with 3~g/d of EPA~+~DHA (TAG fish oil) or 15~g/d of LA (safflower oil), while males (n~=~23) received a dose of 4~g/d of EPA~+~DHA or 20~g/d of LA. In fasting blood samples, we investigated lipoprotein particle subclasses by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as standard lipids, apolipoproteins, fatty acid profiles, and glucose and insulin. Data were analyzed by linear mixed-effects modeling with ‘subjects’ as the random factor. Results The difference between interventions in relative change scores was among the lipoprotein subfractions significant for total very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) (n-3 vs. n-6:~−38\%∗ vs.~+16\%, p~{$<~$}0.001; ∗: significant within-treatment change score), large VLDLs (−58\%∗ vs.~−0.91\%, p~{$<~$}0.001), small VLDLs (−57\%∗ vs.~+41\%∗, p~{$<~$}0.001), total low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (+5.8\%∗ vs.~−4.3\%∗, p~=~0.002), large LDLs (+23\%∗ vs.~−2.1\%, p~=~0.004), total high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) (−6.0\%∗ vs.~+3.7\%, p~{$<~$}0.001), large HDLs (+11\%∗ vs.~−5.3\%, p~=~0.001), medium HDLs (−24\%∗ vs.~+6.2\%, p~=~0.030), and small HDLs (−9.9\%∗ vs.~+9.6\%∗, p~=~0.002), and among standard lipids for TAGs (−16\%∗ vs.~−2.6\%, p~=~0.014), non-esterified fatty acids (−19\%∗ vs.~+5.5\%, p~=~0.033), and total cholesterol (−0.28\% vs.~−4.4\%∗, p~=~0.042). A differential response in relative change scores was also found for apolipoprotein (apo)B (+0.40\% vs.~−6.0\%∗, p~=~0.008), apoA-II (−6.0\%∗ vs.~+1.5\%, p~=~0.001), apoC-II (−11\%∗ vs.~−1.7\%, p~=~0.025), and apoE (+3.3\% vs.~−3.8\%, p~=~0.028). Conclusions High-dose supplementation of high-quality oils with n-3 (EPA~+~DHA) or n-6 (LA) PUFAs was followed by reductions in primarily TAG- or cholesterol-related markers, respectively. The responses after both interventions point to changes in the lipoprotein–lipid–apolipoprotein profile that have been associated with reduced cardiometabolic risk, also among people with TAG or LDL-C levels within the normal range.

Therefore, cholesterol lowering in cancer cells has been envisaged as a potential anticancer strategy. In this direction, two therapeutic strategies have been proposed: (a) to inhibit the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the cells and (b) to deplete excess cholesterol from cancer cells. In the first phase of this review, we collate the cancer signalling pathways (particularly in breast cancer) that are perturbed by cholesterol dyshomeostasis and highlight recent drug discovery efforts to develop cholesterol-lowering compounds, some of which are currently under clinical trials. In the second phase, based on the analysis of the available scientific evidence, we conceptualize and argue that the depletion of excess cholesterol could sensitize cancer cells to available therapeutics and may also help to alleviate cancer drug resistance.},

  abstract = {Health problems associated with essential trace metals can result from both inadequate (i.e., low intake) and excessive exposures (i.e., from environmental and/or occupational source). Thus, measuring the exposure level is a real challenge for epidemiologists. Among non-invasive biomarkers that intend to measure long-term exposure to essential trace metals, the toenail is probably the biological matrix with the greatest potential. This systematic review collects the current evidence regarding the validity of toenail clippings as exposure biomarker for trace metals such as boron, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, silicon, vanadium and zinc. Special attention was paid to the time-window of exposure reflected by the toenail, the intraindividual variability in exposure levels over time in this matrix, and the relationship of toenail with other biomarkers, personal characteristics and environmental sources. Our search identified 139 papers, with selenium and zinc being the most studied elements. The variability among studies suggests that toenail levels may reflect different degrees of exposure and probably correspond to exposures occurred 3–12 months before sampling (i.e., for manganese/selenium). Few studies assessed the reproducibility of results over time and, for samples obtained 1–6 years apart, the correlation coefficient were between 0.26 and 0.66. Trace metal levels in toenails did not correlate well with those in the blood and urine and showed low-moderate correlation with those in the hair and fingernails. Available data suggests that for some elements (Se, Mn, Zn) toenail concentrations reflect long-term external exposures in fairly reproducible levels, while for other metals, this association has not yet been assessed. Among dietary factors, only toenail selenium showed clear associations with the intake of supplements or specific foods. The toenail levels could also represent occupational exposure, for instance, Mn exposure in welders. The scarcity of information on other essential trace elements, together with the great heterogeneity among studies makes the validation of the usage of toenails as biomarkers of exposure to these elements difficult. Standardization of sample collection, quality control, analytical techniques and reporting procedures might facilitate further research focused on the clear understanding of the significance of essential levels in this promising matrix and would enhance its utility in epidemiological research.},

  abstract = {Transferrin receptor (CD71) is involved in the cellular uptake of iron and is expressed on cells with high proliferation. It may be implicated in promoting the growth of endocrine resistant phenotypes within ER+/luminal-like breast cancer. We used a panel of in vitro cell models of acquired resistance to tamoxifen (TAMR), Faslodex (FASR) or severe oestrogen deprivation (MCF-7X) and the ER+ luminal MCF-7 parental line to determine CD71 mRNA expression and to study transferrin (Tf) effects on in vitro tumour growth and its inhibition. Furthermore, CD71 protein expression was assessed in a well-characterized series of patients with invasive breast carcinoma using tissue microarrays. Our results demonstrated a striking elevation of CD71 in all cell models of acquired resistance. Exogenous Tf significantly promoted growth in MCF-7-X and MCF-7 cells but more so in MCF-7-X; this growth was significantly reduced by Faslodex (FAS) or a phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Increased CD71 expression was associated with poor NPI score, tumour proliferation, basal CKs, p53, EGFR, HER2, steroid receptor negativity and shortened breast cancer specific survival (P~{$<~$}0.001). On multivariate analysis, CD71 was found to be an independent prognostic factor in the ER+ cohort of patients. In conclusion, therapies of current interest in breast cancer (e.g. FAS, PI3K-inhibitors) appear able to partially impact on transferrin/CD71-promoted growth, but further investigation of this important mitogenic mechanism may assist in designing new therapeutic strategies to target highly proliferative, endocrine resistant breast cancers. CD71 appears to be a candidate marker of a subgroup of ER+/luminal-like breast cancer characterised by poor outcome and resistance to tamoxifen.},

  abstract = {Iron is an essential mineral needed for normal physiologic processes. While its function in oxygen transport and other important physiologic processes is well known, less is understood about its role in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. Existing paradigms suggest iron as a driver of atherosclerosis through its actions as a pro-oxidant capable of causing lipid oxidation and tissue damage. Recently we and others have identified hemoglobin (Hb) derived iron as an important factor in determining macrophage differentiation and function in areas of intraplaque hemorrhage within human atherosclerosis. Hb associated macrophages, M(Hb), are distinct from traditional macrophage foam cells because they do not contain large amounts of lipid or inflammatory cytokines, are characterized by high levels of expression of mannose receptor (CD206) and CD163 in addition to producing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. Despite the well-known role of iron as an catalyst capable of producing lipid peroxidation through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radical, we and others have shown that macrophages in areas of intraplaque hemorrhage demonstrate reduced intracellular iron and ROS which triggers production of anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as genes involved in cholesterol efflux. These data suggest that manipulation of macrophage iron itself may be a promising pharmacologic target for atherosclerosis prevention through its effects on macrophage inflammation and lipid metabolism. In this review we will summarize the current understanding of iron as it relates to plaque inflammation and discuss how further exploration of this subject may lead to new therapies for atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {Iron is an essential nutrient, yet excess iron can be toxic to cells. The uptake of iron by mammalian cells is post-transcriptionally regulated by the interaction of iron-response proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) with iron-response elements (IREs) found in the mRNAs of genes of iron metabolism, such as ferritin, the transferrin receptor, erythroid aminolevulinic acid synthase, and mitochondrial aconitase. The IRPs are RNA binding proteins that bind to the IRE (found in the mRNAs of the regulated genes) in an iron- dependent manner. Binding of IRPs to the IREs leads to changes in the expression of the regulated genes and subsequent changes in the uptake, utilization, or storage of intracellular iron. Recent work has demonstrated that the binding of the IRPs to the IREs can also be modulated by changes in the redox state or oxidative stress level of the cell. These findings provide an important link between iron metabolism and states of oxidative stress.},

However, many studies use incorrect statistical procedures, fail to fully report the information necessary to interpret their results, or do not address how IRR affects the power of their subsequent analyses for hypothesis testing. This paper provides an overview of methodological issues related to the assessment of IRR with a focus on study design, selection of appropriate statistics, and the computation, interpretation, and reporting of some commonly-used IRR statistics. Computational examples include SPSS and R syntax for computing Cohen’s kappa and intra-class correlations to assess IRR.},

  abstract = {Clinical and experimental evidence suggest that estrogen manipulates intracellular iron metabolism and that elevated levels of estrogen associate with increased systemic iron availability. This has been attributed to the ability of estrogen to suppress hepcidin synthesis, maintain ferroportin integrity and enhance iron release from iron-absorbing duodenal enterocytes and iron-storing macrophages and hepatocytes. These observations speak of a potential “estrogen-iron” axis that manipulates iron metabolism in response to hematologic (erythropoiesis) and non-hematologic (uterine growth, pregnancy, lactation) needs for iron. Such an axis could contribute to minimizing iron deficiency in premenopausal women and iron overload in postmenopausal women. It could also exacerbate iron overload and related clinical consequences including cancer, osteoporosis, cardiovascular complications and neurodegenerative symptoms, especially in postmenopausal women on hormonal replacement therapy. Understanding the role of estrogen in iron metabolism may shed some light on the pleotropic, but often paradoxical, roles of estrogen in human health and disease.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological studies relating a particular exposure to a specified disease may present their results in a variety of ways. Often, results are presented as estimated odds ratios (or relative risks) and confidence intervals (CIs) for a number of categories of exposure, for example, by duration or level of exposure, compared with a single reference category, often the unexposed. For systematic literature review, and particularly meta-analysis, estimates for an alternative comparison of the categories, such as any exposure versus none, may be required. Obtaining these alternative comparisons is not straightforward, as the initial set of estimates is correlated. This paper describes a method for estimating these alternative comparisons based on the ideas originally put forward by Greenland and Longnecker, and provides implementations of the method, developed using Microsoft Excel and SAS. Examples of the method based on studies of smoking and cancer are given. The method also deals with results given by categories of disease (such as histological types of a cancer). The method allows the use of a more consistent comparison when summarizing published evidence, thus potentially improving the reliability of a meta-analysis.

When the low iron diet group became iron deficient, tumor cells (5 × 105 cells/mouse) of CA07-A (colon adenocarcinoma), HE129 (hepatoma), and M119 (mammary adenocarcinoma) were inoculated s.c. in BALB/c, C3H/He, and DBA/2 mice, respectively. All mice developed tumors, tumors grew more slowly, and the mean tumor sizes were smaller in the low iron diet group at nearly all weekly observations in all three strains of mice. No apparent differences in the behavior, activity (e.g., movement, climbing, running, grooming, etc.), and appearance were observed between low iron diet and normal iron diet mice. The mean body weight of mice at transplantation was less in the low iron than in the normal iron groups for the BALB/c strain but higher in the low iron groups of C3H/He and DBA/2 mice, indicating that food intake of mice on a low iron diet was not impaired.

Patients and methods We enrolled all postmenopausal patients diagnosed with stage I-III estrogen receptor positive breast cancer during the years 2007-2017, assigned adjuvant AI treatment, and registered in both the Danish Breast Cancer Group database and the Danish Cancer Registry. We ascertained incident statin exposure ({$>$}= 1 prescription post-diagnosis) from the Danish National Prescription Registry and modeled statins as a time-varying exposure lagged by 6 months. Follow-up began 7 months after diagnosis and continued to the first event of recurrence, death, emigration, 5 years elapsed, or 25th September 2018. We estimated incidence rates of recurrence at 5 years and used Cox regression models to compute crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI), comparing statin exposure with non-exposure. Results We enrolled 14,773 eligible patients. During the 5 years of follow-up, there were 32 recurrences in 3163 person-years of follow-up among statin-exposed patients, and 612 recurrences in 45,655 person-years among unexposed patients (incidence rate per 1000 person-years: 10.12 [95\% CI 6.92-14.28] and 13.40 [95\% CI 12.36-14.51], respectively). In multivariable models, any statin exposure was associated with a reduced rate of 5-year breast cancer recurrence (adjusted HR 0.72 [95\% CI 0.50-1.04]). Considering only lipophilic statins as exposure the results were similar (adjusted HR 0.70 [95\% CI 0.48-1.02]). Conclusions Statin use was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence among postmenopausal patients diagnosed with early stage breast cancer who received adjuvant AI therapy.},

  abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

  abstract = {The use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Haem Fe represents 10-15 \% of dietary Fe intake in meat-rich diets but may contribute 40 \% of the total absorbed Fe. The aim of the present study was to determine the relative effects of type of diet and menstrual Fe loss on Fe status in women. Ninety healthy premenopausal women were recruited according to their habitual diet: red meat, poultry/fish or lacto-ovo-vegetarian. Intake of Fe was determined by analysing 7 d duplicate diets, and menstrual Fe loss was measured using the alkaline haematin method. A substantial proportion of women (60 \% red meat, 40 \% lacto-ovo-vegetarian, 20 \% poultry/fish) had low Fe stores (serum ferritin {$<$} 10 mu g/l), but the median serum ferritin concentration was significantly lower in the red meat group (6.8 mu g/l (interquartile range 3.3, 16.25)) than in the poultry/fish group (17.5 mu g/l (interquartile range 11.3, 22.4) (P {$<$} 0.01). The mean and standard deviation of dietary Fe intake were significantly different between the groups (P=0.025); the red meat group had a significantly lower intake (10.9 (sd 4.3) mg/d) than the lacto-ovo-vegetarians (14.5 (sd 5.5) mg/d), whereas that of the poultry/fish group (12.8 (sd 5.1) mg/d) was not significantly different from the other groups. There was no relationship between total Fe intake and Fe status, but menstrual Fe loss (P=0.001) and dietary group (P=0.040) were significant predictors of Fe status: poultry/fish diets were associated with higher Fe stores than lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets. Identifying individuals with high menstrual losses should be a key component of strategies to prevent Fe deficiency.},

The study was carried out on 27 welders and 31 ferroalloy smelters as Mn-exposed groups and 30 office workers as unexposed controls. Air Mn concentrations were determined according to NIOSH method 7300. The biological samples were prepared using microwave assisted acid digestion and all samples were analyzed by graphite furnace- atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF-AAS) in order to determine manganese. Questionnaire 16 (Q16) and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were used to evaluate the neuropsychological effects. The mean concentrations of air Mn for the welder and ferroalloy smelter groups were 0.023 ± 0.012\hspace{0.25em}mg/m3 and 0.008 ± 0.005\hspace{0.25em}mg/m3, respectively. Manganese concentrations in blood, urine, and toenail samples of exposed workers ranged between 1.80–32.60 (µg/l), 1.00–42.50 (µg/l), and 0.10–6.08 (µg/g), respectively. Mean Mn concentrations in all biological samples of cases were significantly higher than unexposed controls (p{$<$}0.05). A moderate relationship was observed between biomarkers of Mn exposure, air Mn, Q16 as well as some neurocognitive outcome measures. The present study shows that blood Mn, urine Mn and toenail Mn could be used to distinguish Mn-exposed workers from unexposed population at the group level.},

  abstract = {Both diabetes mellitus (DM) and cancer are common diseases and they frequently occur in the same patients. We investigated the all-cause and cause-specific mortality dynamics in relation to baseline DM, statin use and metformin use. The study population consisted of 39,900 incident cancer cases from Finland, 19,822 patients were free of DM at the start of follow-up and 20,078 had DM. Mortality from all causes, and cancer, cardiovascular (CVD) and other causes was analysed using Poisson regression model with the following variables: sex, age, DM, statin and metformin usage in baseline, cancer type and stage and calendar period. Statin usage was associated with a reduced cancer-specific mortality with incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.72 (95\% confidence interval 0.69–0.74), IRR for CVD mortality was 0.95 (0.88–1.02) and for other causes 0.64 (0.56–0.74). In a sub-population of DM patients, IRR for metformin in all-cause mortality was 0.74 (0.71–0.78), in cancer mortality 0.75 (0.72–0.79), in CVD mortality 0.75 (0.68–0.83) and other causes 0.68 (0.60–0.78). In conclusion, our register-based study of survival after cancer diagnosis showed that patients with diabetes had substantially poorer outcome in all measures. An association between baseline statin usage and lower all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular mortality was modified by cancer type. The effect of statin use was largest for breast and colorectal cancer. Metformin usage in a subpopulation of oral antidiabetic users was in general associated with lower mortality, but this association was modified by cancer type. The association was strongest for liver, colorectal and breast cancer.},

Efforts to understand the patterns and consequences of these exposures have been hampered by statistical limitations in estimations of higher order interactions. Objectives The current study uses latent class analysis, a form of person-centered modeling to identify unobservable subgroups within populations and examine relationships between latent classes and measures of immune function. Methods Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2012 were analyzed. A sample of 721 children aged 6–19 years were included who provided data on 47 chemicals of interest representing six chemical classes. Groups were identified using latent class analysis controlling for race/ethnicity, age, sex and poverty status. Results Two alternative approaches to identifying latent classes each resulted in similar three class solutions, including one group of children characterized by low co-exposures across chemicals, a group with moderate co-exposure levels, and a group characterized by high co-occurring levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, phenols and phthalates. Under one of the approaches, latent classes were significantly associated with immune function as measured by lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. Conclusions Latent class analysis offers a potential approach to measuring and understanding interactions among multiple co-occurring chemical stressors. However, additional work is needed to test the ability of latent classes to predict health variables.},

At baseline, concentrations of hemoglobin, serum transferrin and serum ferritin were measured in 10,197 subjects. Data on dietary intake were estimated from six 24-h dietary records completed during the first 2 study years and available for 5287 subjects. All cancer cases that occurred during the 7.5-y follow-up were validated. In men, baseline serum transferrin and serum ferritin concentrations did not differ between subjects with cancers (n = 467) and those without. In women, serum ferritin was higher (P {$<$} 0.0001) and serum transferrin tended to be lower (P {$<$} 0.08) in cancer cases. Iron status was not related to cancer risk in men, but women with serum ferritin concentrations {$>$} 160 mu g/L had an increased risk of cancer (odds ratio = 1.88, 95\% CI: 1.05,3.35).

TRIPOD specific challenges encountered were the existence of different types of prediction model studies and possible combinations of these within publications.

  abstract = {Iron (Fe) and the Fe (II) and Fe (III) dimer are important for normal development of the skin and its appendages such as hair and nails. Although iron is an essential trace metal, the mechanisms regulating iron uptake from the intestinal mucosa and the skin are not well understood. The skin is involved in regulating bodily iron content. Excess iron is lost through perspiration as well as hair and nail growth, but the mechanisms controlling these actions are also not well known. The human body contains 3-5 g of iron, of which up to 75\% may be bound in haemoglobin, with lesser amounts in ferritin, myoglobin and transferrin. However, the minimal levels necessary for the structure and function of the skin seem to be quite low. A normal iron concentration is required for maintaining healthy epidermis, dermis, hair and nails. Fe (II) and Fe (III) dimers such as ferrous ferric chloride are very important for regulating proliferation and differentiation of mouse and human skin cells. Low ferrous ferric chloride concentrations can stimulate mammalian skin functions. Moreover, ferrous ferric chloride can stimulate fibroblast proliferation synergistically with low-molecular-weight collagen and melanocyte differentiation in combination with herbal medicines. Most importantly, ferrous ferric chloride can stimulate proliferation and differentiation of mouse and human skin cells from a distance without being added to the culture medium. These results suggest that ferrous ferric chloride is involved in regulating skin homeostasis through the regulation of the skin-cell turnover.},

  abstract = {Biomarkers of nutrient intake or nutrient status are important objective measures of foods/nutrients as one of the most important environmental factors people are exposed to. It is very difficult to obtain accurate data on individual food intake, and there is a large variation of nutrient composition of foods consumed in a population. Thus, it is difficult to obtain precise measures of exposure to different nutrients and thereby be able to understand the relationship between diet, health, and disease. This is the background for investing considerable resources in studying biomarkers of nutrients believed to be important in our foods. Modern technology with high sensitivity and specificity concerning many nutrient biomarkers has allowed an interesting development with analyses of very small amounts of blood or tissue material. In combination with non-professional collection of blood by finger-pricking and collection on filters or sticks, this may make collection of samples and analyses of biomarkers much more available for scientists as well as health professionals and even lay people in particular in relation to the marked trend of self-monitoring of body functions linked to mobile phone technology. Assuming standard operating procedures are used for collection, drying, transport, extraction, and analysis of samples, it turns out that many analytes of nutritional interest can be measured like metabolites, drugs, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and many types of peptides and proteins. The advantage of this alternative sampling technology is that non-professionals can collect, dry, and mail the samples; the samples can often be stored under room temperature in a dry atmosphere, requiring small amounts of blood. Another promising area is the potential relation between the microbiome and biomarkers that may be measured in feces as well as in blood.},

Hence, a wide range of epidemiological studies have focused on examining the association of dietary heme intake, mainly from red meat, with the risks of common diseases. High heme intake is associated with increased risk of several cancers, including colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer and lung cancer. Likewise, the evidence for increased risks of type-2 diabetes and coronary heart disease associated with high heme intake is compelling. Furthermore, recent comparative metabolic and molecular studies of lung cancer cells showed that cancer cells require increased intracellular heme biosynthesis and uptake to meet the increased demand for oxygen-utilizing hemoproteins. Increased levels of hemoproteins in turn lead to intensified oxygen consumption and cellular energy generation, thereby fueling cancer cell progression. Together, both epidemiological and molecular studies support the idea that heme positively impacts cancer progression. However, it is also worth noting that heme deficiency can cause serious diseases in humans, such as anemia, porphyrias, and Alzheimer's disease. This review attempts to summarize the latest literature in understanding the role of dietary heme intake and heme function in diverse diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous observational studies showed that there was a con ict about serum iron status and the risk of breast cancer, which could have an impact on the prevention of breast cancer. Object: We used a two sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to explore the causal relationship between iron status and the risk of breast cancer. Method: To select single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which could be used as instrumental variables for iron status, we used the Genetics of Iron Status consortium. Moreover, we used the OncoArray network to select SNPs of instrumental variables for the outcome (breast cancer). The conservative instruments (SNPs were all consistent with iron status) and liberal instruments (SNPs was associated with at least one of iron status) were used in MR analysis. In the conservative instruments set we used an inverse-variance weighted (IVW) approach, and in the liberal instruments set we used the IVW, MR-Egger regression, weighted median and simple mode approach. Results: In the conservative approach, none of the iron status were statistically signi cant for breast cancer or its subtypes. And in the liberal approach, transferrin was positively associated with ER-negative breast cancer by simple mode (OR for MR: 1.225; 95\% CI: 1.064, 1.410; P=0.030). However, other iron statuses had no association with breast cancer or its subtypes (P{$>$}0.05). Conclusion: Our MR study, in the liberal approach, suggested that changes in the concentration of transferrin could increase the risk of ER-negative breast cancer, and other iron statuses had no effect on breast cancer or its subtypes. This could be veri ed in future studies.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Adiposity generally accompanies immune cell infiltration and cytokine secretion, which is ideal for tumor development. Aspirin is a chemopreventive agent against several types of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate whether aspirin inhibits the growth of 4T1 breast cancer cells by inhibiting the inflammatory response and regulating the metabolomic profile of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocyte-conditioned medium (Ad-CM) was used to mimic the obese adipose tissue microenvironment in 4T1 cells. The results revealed that aspirin inhibited macrophage chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), interleukin (IL-6), IL-1β, and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) production in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In the obesity-associated model, Ad-CM significantly promoted 4T1 cell growth and migration, which were attenuated after aspirin treatment. The results of metabolic analyses using Ad-CM showed that amino acid metabolites and oxidative stress were increased in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared to those in fibroblasts. Aspirin treatment modified metabolites involved in suppressing lipogenesis, oxidative stress, and neoplastic formation. In the relative fatty acid quantitation analysis of Ad-CM, aspirin diminished fatty acid contents of C16:1, C18:1, C18:2, C20:4, and C24:1. This study is the first to show that aspirin modifies the metabolomics and fatty acid composition of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and inhibits obesity-associated inflammation that contributes to obesity-related breast cancer cell growth and migration.},

While metabolic reprogramming has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer, the role of micronutrients in shaping these adaptations remains scarcely investigated. In particular, the broad electron-transferring abilities of iron make it a versatile cofactor that is involved in a myriad of biochemical reactions vital to cellular homeostasis, including cell respiration and DNA replication. In cancer patients, systemic iron metabolism is commonly altered. Moreover, cancer cells deploy diverse mechanisms to increase iron bioavailability to fuel tumor growth. Although iron itself can readily participate in redox reactions enabling vital processes, its reactivity also gives rise to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hence, cancer cells further rely on antioxidant mechanisms to withstand such stress. The present review provides an overview of the common alterations of iron metabolism occurring in cancer and the mechanisms through which iron promotes tumor growth.},

In this paper, we study an alternative conceptual framework, the “percentile value.” In this framework, the controls only provide a reference distribution to standardize the marker. The analysis proceeds by analyzing the standardized marker in cases. The approach is shown to be equivalent to ROC analysis. Advantages are that it provides a framework familiar to a broad spectrum of biostatisticians and it opens up avenues for new statistical techniques in biomarker evaluation. We develop several new procedures based on this framework for comparing biomarkers and biomarker performance in different populations. We develop methods that adjust such comparisons for covariates. The methods are illustrated on data from 2 cancer biomarker studies.},

However, these risk factors cannot explain the differences in the incidence and recurrence of breast cancer between premenopausal and postmenopausal women. In this paper I propose that, in premenopausal women, an iron deficiency caused by menstruation stabilises hypoxia inducible factor-la, which increases the formation of vascular endothelial growth factor. This mechanism results in premenopausal women being more susceptible to angiogenesis and, consequently, leads to a high recurrence of breast cancer. Conversely, increased concentrations of iron in postmenopausal women, as a result of menstrual cessation, contribute to a high incidence of breast cancer via oxidative-stress pathways. Although the focus of this Personal View is on iron, this by no means negates the roles of other known risk factors in breast-cancer development. Characterisation of the role of iron in breast cancer could potentially benefit patients by decreasing recurrence and incidence and increasing overall survival.},

  abstract = {Our primary objective is to provide the clinical informatics community with an introductory tutorial on calibration measurements and calibration models for predictive models using existing R packages and custom implemented code in R on real and simulated data. Clinical predictive model performance is commonly published based on discrimination measures, but use of models for individualized predictions requires adequate model calibration. This tutorial is intended for clinical researchers who want to evaluate predictive models in terms of their applicability to a particular population. It is also for informaticians and for software engineers who want to understand the role that calibration plays in the evaluation of a clinical predictive model, and to provide them with a solid starting point to consider incorporating calibration evaluation and calibration models in their work.Covered topics include (1) an introduction to the importance of calibration in the clinical setting, (2) an illustration of the distinct roles that discrimination and calibration play in the assessment of clinical predictive models, (3) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration measurements, (4) a tutorial and demonstration of selected calibration models, and (5) a brief discussion of limitations of these methods and practical suggestions on how to use them in practice.},

  abstract = {Objectives To develop and validate a prediction model for fat mass in children aged 4-15 years using routinely available risk factors of height, weight, and demographic information without the need for more complex forms of assessment. Design Individual participant data meta-analysis. Setting Four population based cross sectional studies and a fifth study for external validation, United Kingdom. Participants A pooled derivation dataset (four studies) of 2375 children and an external validation dataset of 176 children with complete data on anthropometric measurements and deuterium dilution assessments of fat mass. Main outcome measure Multivariable linear regression analysis, using backwards selection for inclusion of predictor variables and allowing non-linear relations, was used to develop a prediction model for fat-free mass (and subsequently fat mass by subtracting resulting estimates from weight) based on the four studies. Internal validation and then internal-external cross validation were used to examine overfitting and generalisability of the model’s predictive performance within the four development studies; external validation followed using the fifth dataset. Results Model derivation was based on a multi-ethnic population of 2375 children (47.8\% boys, n=1136) aged 4-15 years. The final model containing predictor variables of height, weight, age, sex, and ethnicity had extremely high predictive ability (optimism adjusted R2: 94.8\%, 95\% confidence interval 94.4\% to 95.2\%) with excellent calibration of observed and predicted values. The internal validation showed minimal overfitting and good model generalisability, with excellent calibration and predictive performance. External validation in 176 children aged 11-12 years showed promising generalisability of the model (R2: 90.0\%, 95\% confidence interval 87.2\% to 92.8\%) with good calibration of observed and predicted fat mass (slope: 1.02, 95\% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.07). The mean difference between observed and predicted fat mass was −1.29 kg (95\% confidence interval −1.62 to −0.96 kg). Conclusion The developed model accurately predicted levels of fat mass in children aged 4-15 years. The prediction model is based on simple anthropometric measures without the need for more complex forms of assessment and could improve the accuracy of assessments for body fatness in children (compared with those provided by body mass index) for effective surveillance, prevention, and management of clinical and public health obesity.},

  abstract = {Iron differs from other minerals because iron balance in the human body is regulated by absorption only because there is no physiologic mechanism for excretion. On the basis of intake data and isotope studies, iron bioavailability has been estimated to be in the range of 14-18\% for mixed diets and 5-12\% for vegetarian diets in subjects with no iron stores, and these values have been used to generate dietary reference values for all population groups. Dietary factors that influence iron absorption, such as phytate, polyphenols, calcium, ascorbic acid, and muscle tissue, have been shown repeatedly to influence iron absorption in single-meal isotope studies, whereas in multimeal studies with a varied diet and multiple inhibitors and enhancers, the effect of single components has been, as expected, more modest. The importance of fortification iron and food additives such as erythorbic acid on iron bioavailability from a mixed diet needs clarification. The influence of vitamin A, carotenoids, and non-digestible carbohydrates on iron absorption and the nature of the "meat factor" remain unresolved. The iron status of the individual and other host factors, such as obesity, play a key role in iron bioavailability, and iron status generally has a greater effect than diet composition. It would therefore be timely to develop a range of iron bioavailability factors based not only on diet composition but also on subject characteristics, such as iron status and prevalence of obesity.

  abstract = {Background Increased exposure to endogenous estrogen and/or insulin may partly explain the relationship of obesity, physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption and postmenopausal breast cancer. However, these potential mediating effects have not been formally quantified in a survival analysis setting. Methods We combined data from two case–cohort studies based in the Women’s Health Initiative- Observational Study with serum estradiol levels, one of which also had insulin levels. A total of 1,601 women (601 cases) aged 50 to 79 years who were not using hormone therapy at enrollment were included. Mediating effects were estimated by applying a new method based on the additive hazard model. Results A five-unit increase in body mass index (BMI) was associated with 50.0 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 23.2–76.6] extra cases per 100,000 women at-risk per year. Of these, 23.8\% (95\% CI, 2.9–68.4) could be attributed to estradiol and 65.8\% (95\% CI, 13.6–273.3) through insulin pathways. The mediating effect of estradiol was greater (48.8\%; 95\% CI, 18.8–161.1) for BMI when restricted to estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cases. Consuming 7+ drinks/wk compared with abstinence was associated with 164.9 (95\% CI, 45.8–284.9) breast cancer cases per 100,000, but no significant contribution from estradiol was found. The effect of alcohol on breast cancer was restricted to ER+ breast cancers. Conclusions The relation of BMI with breast cancer was partly mediated through estradiol and, to a greater extent, through insulin. Impact The findings provide support for evaluation of interventions to lower insulin and estrogen levels in overweight and obese postmenopausal women to reduce breast cancer risk.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Mendelian randomisation allows for the testing of causal effects in situations where clinical trials are challenging to do. In this hypothesis-free, data-driven phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), we sought to assess possible associations of high body-mass index (BMI) with multiple disease outcomes. Methods For this registry-based case-control PheWAS, we used genome-wide data available from the UK Biobank to construct a genetic risk score of 76 variants related to BMI. Eligible UK Biobank participants were aged 37–73 years during recruitment, were white British, were unrelated to each other, and had available genetic information. Disease outcomes from these participants were mapped to a phenotype code (phecode). Participants with a phecode of interest were recoded as cases, whereas participants without a phecode of interest or any codes under a parent phecode were classified as controls. We did a PheWAS to analyse possible associations between the BMI genetic risk score and a range of disease outcomes. Disease associations passing stringent correction for multiple testing (Bonferroni corrected threshold p{$<$}5·4\hphantom{,}×\hphantom{,}10−5, false discovery rate corrected p{$<$}0·0074) were assessed for causal association with use of inverse-variance weighted mendelian randomisation. We did sensitivity analyses to assess pleiotropy and stability of estimation with use of weighted median, weighted mode, Egger regression, and mendelian randomisation pleiotropy residual sum and outlier methods. Findings Our study population comprised 337\hphantom{,}536 UK Biobank participants, and analyses were done for 925 unique phecodes from 17 different disease categories. After Bonferroni correction, PheWAS identified that BMI genetic risk score was associated with hospital-diagnosed obesity and 58 other outcomes; 30 distinct disease associations were supported by the mendelian randomisation analyses. 30 distinct disease associations were supported by the mendelian randomisation analyses. In inverse-variance weighted mendelian randomisation, genetically determined BMI was associated with endocrine disorders (odds ratio per one SD or 4·1 kg/m2 higher BMI 2·72, 95\% CI 2·33–3·29 for type 2 diabetes; 2·11, 1·62–2·76 for type 1 diabetes; and 1·46, 1·25–1·70 for hypothyroidism), circulatory diseases (1·96, 1·53–2·51 for phlebitis and thrombophlebitis; 1·89, 1·39–2·57 for cardiomegaly; 1·68, 1·35–2·09 for congestive heart failure; 1·55, 1·37–1·76 for hypertension; 1·31, 1·13–1·52 for ischaemic heart disease; and 1·25, 1·14–1·37 for cardiac dysrhythmias), and inflammatory or dermatological conditions (2·00, 1·72–2·23 for superficial cellulitis and abscess; 3·37, 2·17–5·25 for chronic ulcers of leg and foot; 4·99, 2·54–9·82 for gangrene; and 2·24, 1·53–3·28 for atopy). Mendelian randomisation analyses provided further support for a causal effect of BMI on renal failure, osteoarthrosis, neurological (insomnia and peripheral nerve disorders) and respiratory diseases (asthma and chronic bronchitis), structural problems (hernias and knee derangement), and chemotherapy treatment. Mendelian randomisation with Egger regression produced consistently wider CIs compared with those of other methods. 26 of 72 distinct diseases detected under false discovery rate correction produced consistent estimates across at least four mendelian randomisation methods, and consistent evidence across all five approaches was obtained for 14 diseases. Interpretation Our data-driven approach identified a range of diseases as possibly affected by high BMI. This population-level screening approximated the accumulated consequences of high BMI, whereas the true effects might be more complex and vary by life stage. Our results highlight the importance of obesity prevention and effective management of obesity-related comorbidities. Funding National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.},

  abstract = {Background: Hormonal vitamin D system affects the determination of T-cell responses. It is unknown if there is an association between vitamin D status and allergic conditions. Our aim was to investigate differences in serum IgE concentrations by vitamin D status [measured by 25(OH)D] and by a genetic variation in a key vitamin D activation enzyme (CYP27B1) previously shown to be associated with type 1 diabetes. Methods: 9377 participants in the 1958 British birth cohort completed a biomedical assessment at 45 years of age ; 7288 eligible participants had data on 25(OH)D and IgE, with 6429 having further information on CYP27B1 genotype (−1260C{$>$}A). Results: There was a nonlinear association between 25(OH)D and IgE (P-value for curvature = 0.0001). Compared with the reference group with the lowest IgE concentrations [25(OH)D 100–125 nmol/l], IgE concentrations were 29\% higher (95\% CI 9–48\%) for participants with the 25(OH)D {$<$}25 nmol/l, and 56\% higher (95\% CI 17–95\%) for participants with 25(OH)D {$>$}135 nmol/l (adjusted for sex, month, smoking, alcohol consumption, time spent outside, geographical location, social class, PC/TV time, physical activity, body mass index and waist circumference). CYP27B1 genotype was associated with both 25(OH)D (difference for A vs. C allele: 1.88\%, 95\% CI 0.37–3.4\%, P = 0.01) and IgE concentrations (−6.59\%, −11.6\% to −1.42\%, P = 0.01). Conclusions: These data suggest that there may be a threshold effect with both low and high 25(OH)D levels associated with elevated IgE concentrations. The same CYP27B1 allele that is protective of diabetes was associated with increased IgE concentrations.},

  abstract = {Multivariable prediction models are important statistical tools for providing synthetic diagnosis and prognostic algorithms based on patients’ multiple characteristics. Their apparent measures for predictive accuracy usually have overestimation biases (known as ‘optimism’) relative to the actual performances for external populations. Existing statistical evidence and guidelines suggest that three bootstrap-based bias correction methods are preferable in practice, namely Harrell’s bias correction and the .632 and .632+ estimators. Although Harrell’s method has been widely adopted in clinical studies, simulation-based evidence indicates that the .632+ estimator may perform better than the other two methods. However, these methods’ actual comparative effectiveness is still unclear due to limited numerical evidence.},

Simvastatin (SIM), a lipid-lowering agent, has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth. The study aimed at investigating the impact of using SIM with TAM in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell line, T47D, as well as in mice-bearing Ehrlich solid tumor. The cell line was treated with different concentrations of TAM or/and SIM for 72\,h. The effects of treatment on cytotoxicity, oxidative stress markers, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis were investigated. Our results showed that the combination treatment decreased the oxidative stress markers, glucose uptake, VEGF, and MMP 2 \&9 in the cell line compared to TAM- treated cells. Drug interaction of TAM and SIM was synergistic in T47D by increasing the apoptotic makers Bax/BCL-2 ratio and caspase 3 activity. Additionally, in vivo, the combination regimen resulted in a non-significant decrease in the tumor volume compared to TAM treated group. Moreover, the combined treatment decreased the protein expression of TNF-α, NF-kB compared to control. In conclusion, our results suggest that SIM may serve as a promising treatment with TAM for improving the efficacy against estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer.},

For this purpose, levels of these elements were measured in 31 patients with epilepsy and 19 healthy subjects. Element analyses were carried out by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). Increased Mn levels were detected in nail of patients with epilepsy compared to healthy controls (P{$<$}.008). The main nail Zn and Cu levels were found to be unchanged in epileptic patients compared to control subjects. There were no significant differences in serum Mn and Zn levels between epileptic patients and control subjects. However, there was a statistically significant increase in serum Cu levels in patients with epilepsy in comparison with control group (P{$<$}.009). Our results demonstrate that some trace element levels may vary in epileptic patients, and because of the more stable status, the analysis of these element levels in some tissues such as nail might be superior to serum analysis.},

  abstract = {Background: Dietary supplements are widely used by cancer survivors. However, health effects among older cancer survivors are unclear. Methods: We used the Iowa Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study with 2,118 postmenopausal women with a confirmed cancer diagnosis (1986-2002), to evaluate the association between postdiagnosis dietary supplement use assessed in 2004 and subsequent all-cause mortality. Risk of death was evaluated using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. We performed stratified analyses by diet quality score, dietary micronutrient intake, and perceived general health. Results: Through 2010, 608 deaths were identified. Approximately 85\% of the cancer survivors used dietary supplements. Overall supplement use and multivitamin use were not associated with mortality. Iron supplement use was associated with 39\% higher risk of death [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.77]. This association was stronger among survivors with deteriorating general health. Folic acid supplement use was associated with higher risk of death, only among survivors reporting low-quality diets (HR, 2.33; 95\% CI, 1.334.08; P-interaction = 0.006). Multivitamin use and using a greater number of supplements was associated with a trend towards higher mortality only among those with poor diet quality. Using vitamin E supplements in combination with multivitamin was associated with lower risk of death only among survivors with higher dietary vitamin E intake (HR, 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.94; P-interaction 0.02). Conclusions: Postdiagnosis supplement use was associated with higher mortality among older female cancer survivors with poor general health and/ or poor dietary intake. Impact: The association between postdiagnosis dietary supplement use and mortality may differ by diet quality and health status among older female cancer survivors.},

Ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe3+-NTA) plus hydrogen peroxide caused strong DNA cleavage in the presence of albumin. No or little DNA cleavage was observed with ferric chloride or Fe3+ chelates of other aminopolycarboxylic acids tested in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The DNA cleavage by Fe3+-NTA plus hydrogen peroxide without piperidine treatment occurred at positions of every nucleotide although a specific cleavage was observed, whereas cleavages at the positions of guanine and thymine increased predominantly with piperidine treatment. Electron spin resonance studies using free radical traps demonstrated that of Fe3+ chelates of aminopolycarboxylic acids, Fe3+-NTA was the most effective catalyst in hydrogen peroxide-derived production of hydroxyl radicals under our conditions. The results suggest that Fe3+-NTA catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals, which subsequently cause the strong base alterations of guanine and thymine, and deoxyribose-phosphate backbone breakages. The possibility that the Fe3+-NTA-induced DNA damage is the initiation and/or promotion of carcinogenesis by Fe3+-NTA is discussed.},

Methods: Adult participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who did not consume alcohol (n = 8839) were compared with participants who consumed ≤1 (n = 4976), {$>$}1 to ≤2 (n = 1153), or {$>$}2 (n = 915) alcoholic drinks/day during the preceding 12 months. We examined the following markers of iron overload: elevated serum transferrin-iron saturation (TS) level ({$>$}45\%, {$>$}50\%, and {$>$}60\%), elevated serum ferritin level ({$>$}300, {$>$}400, {$>$}500, and {$>$}600 ng/mL), and combinations of both elevated serum TS and ferritin levels. Iron deficiency was defined as the presence of at least 2 of the following: serum ferritin level {$<$}12 ng/mL, serum TS level {$<$}15\%, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin level {$>$}1.24 μmol/L. Iron deficiency anemia was defined as the presence of both iron deficiency and anemia. Results: Compared with nondrinkers, the prevalence of all markers of iron overload was significantly elevated among those who consumed {$>$}2 alcoholic drinks/day after adjusting for potential confounders. Consumption of any amount of alcohol was associated with a 40\% reduction in the risk of iron deficiency anemia. Conclusions: Consumption of up to 2 alcoholic drinks/day seems to be associated with reduced risk of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia without a concomitant increase in the risk of iron overload. Consumption of {$>$}2 alcoholic drinks/day is associated with a significant elevation in the risk of iron overload.},

Autoclaved iron particles were implanted in the vitreous cavities of the experimental eyes. Glass chips were implanted in the control eyes. The experimental eyes were enucleated at various time intervals from days 1 to 15. Retinal degeneration was examined using the TdT-mediated, dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method. Electrophoresis on agarose gel was used to detect internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. RESULTS. TUNEL-positive nuclei were observed only in the outer nuclear layer beginning on day 2. The nuclei spread throughout the outer nuclear layer by the end of day 3. No TUNEL-positive nuclei were observed in other layers throughout the experimental period. Analysis of DNA, extracted from the retinas by electrophoresis on agarose gel, revealed a typical ladder pattern of internucleosomal DNA cleavage in the experimental eyes. CONCLUSIONS. Apoptosis occurred during photoreceptor cell death at the early phase of iron-induced retinopathy in these rats. Like photic injury, iron-induced apoptosis was limited to the outer nuclear layer.},

  abstract = {Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are known mutagens and animal carcinogens produced in meats cooked at high temperature. As pork is the second most frequently consumed meat in the United States, five predominant HCAs [2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP)] were measured in various pork products, cooked by different techniques and to varying doneness levels. Pork chops and ham slices were pan-fried and oven-broiled; bacon was pan-fried, oven-broiled or microwaved: hot dogs were pan-fried, oven-broiled, grilled/barbecued or boiled; sausage links and patties were pan-fried. All the products were cooked to three levels of doneness: just until done, well done or very well done. HCA type and level varied substantially by pork product, cooking method and doneness level. The highest PhIP levels were found in well done and very well done oven-broiled bacon; for very well done 30.3 and 4.0 ng per gram of meat of PhIP and MeIQx, respectively. Pan-fried very well done sausage patties contained 5.4 ng of MeIQx per gram of meat, while sausage links contained 1.3 ng per gram of meat. MeIQx was formed in well done and very well done pan-fried but not broiled pork chops. Hot dogs or ham slices had low or undetectable levers of HCAs. These results demonstrate that epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between HCA intake and cancer risk need to incorporate type of meat, cooking method and degree of doneness/surface browning into questions to assess adequately an individual's HCA exposure.

Here, c-MYC is shown to repress the expression of the heavy subunit of the protein ferritin (H-ferritin), which sequesters intracellular iron, and to stimulate the expression of the iron regulatory protein-2 (IRP2), which increases the intracellular iron pool. Downregulation of the expression of H-ferritin gene was required for cell transformation by c-MYC. These results indicate that c-MYC coordinately regulates genes controlling intracellular iron concentrations and that this function is essential for the control of cell proliferation and transformation by c-MYC.},

The aim of this study is to assess the relation between ferritin levels and tumor volume, size and prognosis in RCC. Methods: We studied ferritin levels in serum from peripheral and renal veins of 52 patients with RCC who underwent surgery. Ferritin levels were measured by an enzyme immunoassay method. Tumor volume and the largest tumor diameter were calculated from the pathologic specimens. Results: The mean serum ferritin level from the renal vein (RVF) was statistically higher than the ferritin level from the peripheral vein (PVF) (p = 0.028). Although mean RVF level increased with increasing stage, it was not significant. While there was a correlation with tumor size, volume and RVF, PVF was in correlation with disease status. PVF in patients with metastatic and/or locally advanced disease was significantly higher than the patients with localized disease (p = 0.023), The initial RVF and PVF levels were predictive of survival (p = 0.028 and p = 0.034, respectively). Conclusions: Higher levels in the renal vein, its positive correlation with tumor size and volume suggest that ferritin is expressed by RCC. Initial peripheral serum values of ferritin can be indicative of disease status and also be a prognosticator of survival.},

  abstract = {The intake of a Western diet with a high amount of red meat is associated with a high risk for colon cancer. We hypothesize that heme, the iron carrier of red meat, is involved in diet-induced colonic epithelial damage, resulting in increased epithelial proliferation. Rats were fed purified control diets, or purified diets supplemented with 1.3 mu mol/g of hemin (ferriheme), protoporphyrin LY, ferric citrate, or bilirubin (rt = 8/group) for 14 days. Feces were collected for biochemical analyses. Fecal cytotoxicity was determined from the degree of lysis of erythrocytes by fecal water. Colonic epithelial proliferation was measured in vivo using [H-3]thymidine incorporation into colonic mucosa. The colonic epithelial proliferation in heme-fed rats was significantly increased compared to control rats [55.2 +/- 5.8 versus 32.6 +/- 6.3 dpm/mu g DNA (mean +/- SE); P {$<$} 0.05]. The fecal water of the heme group was highly cytotoxic compared to the controls (90 +/- 2\% versus 2 +/- 1\%; P {$<$} 0.001), although the concentrations of cytotoxic bile acids and fatty acids were significantly lower. Organic iron was significantly increased compared to the controls (257 +/- 26 versus 80 +/- 21 mu M; P {$<$} 0.001). Spectrophotometric analyses suggest that this organic iron is heme-associated, Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were greatly increased in the fecal water of heme-fed rats compared to the controls (177 +/- 12 versus 59 +/- 7 mu M; P {$<$} 0.05), Heme itself could not account for the increased cytotoxicity. because the addition of heme to the fecal water of the control group, which was equimolar to the organic iron content of the fecal water of the heme group, did not influence the cytotoxicity. Hence, an additional heme-induced cytotoxic factor is involved, which may be modulated by the generation of luminal-reactive oxygen species. Protoporphyrin IX, ferric citrate, and bilirubin did not increase proliferation and cytotoxicity. In conclusion, dietary heme leads to the formation of an unknown, highly cytotoxic factor in the colonic lumen. This suggests that, in heme-fed rats, colonic mucosa is damaged by the intestinal contents, This results in a compensatory hyperproliferation of the epithelium, which supposedly increases the risk for colon cancer.},

Ireg1 mRNA and protein expression are increased under conditions of increased iron absorption, and the 5' UTR of the Ireg1 mRNA contains a functional iron-responsive element (IRE).

To determine the incidence of these events, we performed a multicentre prospective study of the chelator. Blood counts were performed weekly and confirmed neutropenia mandated discontinuation of therapy. Among 187 patients with thalassaemia major, the incidence of agranulocytosis (neutrophils {$<$} 0.5 x 10(9)/l) was 0.6/100 patient-years, and the incidence of milder forms of neutropenia (neutrophils 0.5-1.5 x 10(9)/l) was 5.4/100 patient-years. All cases of neutropenia resolved after interruption of therapy. Neutropenia occurred predominantly in non-splenectomized patients. Nausea and/or vomiting occurred early in therapy, was usually transient and caused discontinuation of deferiprone in three patients. Mild to moderate joint pain and/or swelling did not require permanent cessation of deferiprone and occurred more commonly in patients with higher ferritin levels. Mean alanine transaminase (ALT) levels rose during therapy. Increased ALT levels were generally transient and occurred more commonly in patients with hepatitis C. Persistent changes in immunological studies were infrequent, although sporadic abnormalities occurred commonly. Mean zinc levels decreased during therapy. Ferritin levels did not change in the overall group but decreased in those patients with baseline levels {$>$} 2500 mu g/l. This study characterized the safety profile of deferiprone, and, under the specific conditions of monitoring, demonstrated that agranulocytosis is less common than previously predicted.},

The condition is distinct from the well-characterised HLA-linked haemochromatosis described in Caucasians. Increased dietary iron intake predisposes to the condition. Recent evidence suggest that African iron overload may be caused by an interaction between increased dietary iron and a genetic defect not associated with the HLA-locus. Iron deposition is prominent both in macrophages and in hepatic parenchymal cells. Iron overload is distinct from alcoholic liver disease, although the excess dietary iron is derived from a traditional beverage that contains alcohol. African iron overload has clinical consequences. It is a cause of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, and associations with diabetes mellitus, peritonitis, scurvy and osteoporosis have been described. African iron overload may be a cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. The disorder is associated with a poor outcome in tuberculosis, an infection that is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.},

  abstract = {High intake of red meat is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. It has been suggested that fat from red meat is responsible, because high fat intake increases the concentration of cytotoxic lipids in the colon. Experimental studies have not unequivocally supported such a role fbr fat, however. Recently, we showed that dietary haem, which is abundant in red meat, increased colonic cytotoxicity and epithelial proliferation. In this study, we wanted to clarify whether dietary fat affects colon cancer risk by itself or by modulating the detrimental effects of haem on the colonic epithelium. Rats were fed control or haem-supplemented diets with 10\%, 25\% or 40\% of the energy derived from fat for 14 days. Faeces were collected for biochemical analyses. Colonic cytotoxicity was determined from the degree of lysis of erythrocytes by faecal water: Colonic epithelial proliferation was measured in vivo using [H-3]thymidine incorporation. Increasing the fat content of the control diets stimulated faecal disposal of both fatty acids and bile acids. It also increased the concentration of fatty acids, but not that of bile acids, in faecal water in control rats. The cytolytic activity of faecal water and colonic epithelial proliferation were unaffected. Dietary haem increased faecal cation content and cytolytic activity of faecal water at all fat levels, suggesting that the colonic mucosa was exposed to high amounts of luminal irritants. This effect was smaller in rats on the low-fat diet. Dietary haem also increased colonic epithelial proliferation at all fat levels. The haem-induced effects were independent of fatty acids or bile acids in the faecal water. In western societies, 30-40\% of ingested energy is supplied by dietary fat, so our results suggest that the association between consumption of red meat and risk of colon cancer is mainly due to its haem content, and is largely independent of dietary fat content.},

  abstract = {Iron is suspected to be involved in the induction and/or progression of various human tumors. More particularly, iron may be involved in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma, a tumor of probable vascular origin. This study was designed to investigate the effect of iron deprivation on Kaposi's sarcoma. The effects of iron chelators and iron deprivation associated with serum withdrawal were investigated on Kaposi's sarcoma-derived spindle cells, on a transformed Kaposi's sarcoma cell line (Kaposi's sarcoma Y-1) and on endothelial cells, which are the probable progenitors of Kaposi's sarcoma cells. Desferrioxamine and deferiprone, two chemically unrelated iron chelators, induced a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of endothelial and Kaposi's sarcoma cell growth. The inhibition of cell growth was associated with a decrease in Ki-67 and in both stable and total proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. Inhibition of the progression through the G(1)-phase of the cell cycle was further evidenced by decreased expression of cyclin D1 and of p34 cyclin-dependent kinase 4. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated desoxyuridinetriphosphate nick end labeling assay, flow cytometry with annexin-V-fluorescein and morphologic analysis indicated that iron chelation also induced a time- and concentration-dependent apoptosis. This apoptotic effect was prevented by the addition of exogenous iron. Induction of iron deprivation in the culture medium by serum withdrawal led to similar cell cycle effects, which, however, could only be partly reverted by the addition of exogenous iron. In conclusion, these results show that iron deprivation inhibits the growth and induces the apoptosis of Kaposi's sarcoma cells and of their putative endothelial precursors. This suggests that iron chelators may represent a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.},

  abstract = {Considering that the development of hepatic lesions related to iron overload diseases might be a result of abnormally expressed hepatic genes, we searched for new genes up-regulated under the condition of iron excess. By suppressive subtractive hybridization performed between livers from carbonyl iron-overloaded and control mice, we isolated a 225-base pair cDNA. By Northern blot analysis, the corresponding mRNA was confirmed to be overexpressed in livers of experimentally (carbonyl iron and iron-dextran-treated mice) and spontaneously (beta (2)-microglobulin knockout mice) iron-overloaded mice. In addition, beta (2)-microglobulin knockout mice fed with a low iron content diet exhibited a decrease of hepatic mRNA expression. The murine full-length cDNA was Isolated and was found to encode an 83-amino acid protein presenting a strong homology in its C-terminal region to the human antimicrobial peptide hepcidin, In addition, we cloned the corresponding rat and human orthologue cDNAs, Both mouse and human genes named HEPC are constituted of 3 exons and 2 introns and are located on chromosome 7 and 19, respectively, in close proximity to USF2 gene. In mouse and human, HEPC mRNA was predominantly expressed in the liver. During both in vivo and in vitro studies, HEPC mRNA expression was enhanced in mouse hepatocytes under the effect of lipopolysaccharide. Finally, to analyze the intracellular localization of the predicted protein, we used the green fluorescent protein chimera expression vectors. The murine green fluorescent protein-prohepcidin protein was exclusively localized in the nucleus. When the putative nuclear localization signal was deleted, the resulting protein was addressed to the cytoplasm. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the product of the new liver-specific gene HEPC might play a specific role during iron overload and exhibit additional functions distinct from its antimicrobial activity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. Anemia is common in cancer patients, although the prevalence is influenced both by the type of malignancy and the choice of treatment. Individual studies have compared the survival of patients with and without anemia and have shown reduced survival times in patients with various malignancies, including carcinoma of the lung, cenix, head and neck, prostate, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. The objective of this study was to systematically review, to summarize, and to obtain an overall estimate of the effect of anemia on survival in patients with malignant disease. METHODS. A comprehensive literature review was carried out using the MEDLINE data base and reviewing the reference lists from published studies. Two hundred papers were identified. Of these, 60 papers that reported the survival of cancer patients according to either hemoglobin levels or the presence of anemia were included. Among these papers, 25\% related to patients with lung carcinoma, 17\% related to patients with head and neck carcinoma, 12\% related to patients with multiple myeloma, 10\% related to patients with prostate carcinoma, 8\% related to patients with cervicouterine carcinoma, 7\% related to patients with leukemia, 5\% related to patients with lymphoma, and 16\% related to patients with other types of malignancies. RESULTS. The relative risk of death increased by 19\% (95\% confidence interval, 10-29\%) in anemic patients with lung carcinoma, by 75\% (37-123\%) in anemic patients with head and neck carcinoma, by 47\% (21-78\%) in anemic patients with prostate carcinoma, and by 67\% (30-113\%) in anemic patients with lymphoma. The overall estimate increase in risk was 65\% (54-77\%). CONCLUSIONS, Anemia is associated with shorter survival times for patients with lung carcinoma, cervicouterine carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma.

  abstract = {We previously reported the disruption of the murine gene encoding the transcription factor USF2 and its consequences on glucose-dependent gene regulation in the liver. We report here a peculiar phenotype of Usf2(-/-) mice that progressively develop multivisceral iron overload; plasma iron overcomes transferrin binding capacity, and nontransferrin-bound iron accumulates in various tissues including pancreas and heart. In contrast, the splenic iron content is strikingly lower in knockout animals than in controls. To identify genes that may account for the abnormalities of iron homeostasis in Usf2(-/-) mice, we used suppressive subtractive hybridization between livers from Usf2(-/-) and wild-type mice. We isolated a cDNA encoding a peptide, hepcidin (also referred to as LEAP-1, for liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide), that was very recently purified from human blood ultrafiltrate and from urine as a disulfide-bonded peptide exhibiting antimicrobial activity. Accumulation of iron in the liver has been recently reported to up-regulate hepcidin expression, whereas our data clearly show that a complete defect in hepcidin expression is responsible for progressive tissue iron overload. The striking similarity of the alterations in iron metabolism between HFE knockout mice, a murine model of hereditary hemochromatosis, and the Usf2(-/-) hepcidin-deficient mice suggests that hepcidin may function in the same regulatory pathway as HFE. We propose that hepcidin acts as a signaling molecule that is required in conjunction with HFE to regulate both intestinal iron absorption and iron storage in macrophages.},

  abstract = {With rare exceptions, virtually all studied organisms from Archaea to man are dependent on iron for survival. Despite the ubiquitous distribution and abundance of iron in the biosphere, iron-dependent life must contend with the paradoxical hazards of iron deficiency and iron overload, each with its serious or fatal consequences. Homeostatic mechanisms regulating the absorption, transport, storage and mobilization of cellular iron are therefore of critical importance in iron metabolism, and a rich biology and chemistry underlie all of these mechanisms. A coherent understanding of that biology and chemistry is now rapidly emerging. In this review we will emphasize discoveries of the past decade, which have brought a revolution to the understanding of the molecular events in iron metabolism. Of central importance has been the discovery of new proteins carrying out functions previously suspected but not understood or, more interestingly, unsuspected and surprising. Parallel discoveries have delineated regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression of proteins long known - the transferrin receptor and ferritin - as well as proteins new to the scene of iron metabolism and its homeostatic control. These proteins include the iron regulatory proteins (IRPs I and 2), a variety of ferrireductases in yeast an mammalian cells, membrane transporters (DMTI and ferroportin 1), a multicopper ferroxidase involved in iron export from cells (hephaestin), and regulators of mitochondrial iron balance (frataxin and MFT). Experimental models, making use of organisms from yeast through the zebrafish to rodents have asserted their power in elucidating normal iron metabolism, as well as its genetic disorders and their underlying molecular defects. Iron absorption, previously poorly understood, is now a fruitful subject for research and well on its way to detailed elucidation. The long-sought hemochromatosis; gene has been found, and active research is underway to determine how its aberrant functioning results in disease that is easily controlled but lethal when untreated. A surprising connection between iron metabolism and Friedreich's ataxia has been uncovered. It is no exaggeration to say that the new understanding of iron metabolism in health and disease has been explosive, and that what is past is likely to be prologue to what is ahead.

  abstract = {\{Iron is involved in essential biochemical reactions ranging from  respiration to DNA synthesis. Consequently, iron deprivation has been  proposed as a strategy for inhibition of tumor cell growth. We recently  described a novel iron chelator, tachypyridine \{[\}N,N ` ,N ``  -tris(2-pyridylmethyl)-cis,cis-1,3,5-triaminocyclohexane], and  demonstrated that it not only inhibited growth of cultured tumor cells,  but was actively cytotoxic. Here we explore the mechanisms underlying  tachpyridine cytotoxicity. Using several criteria, including time-lapse  video microscopy, DNA staining and TUNEL assays, tachpyridine was shown  to specifically induce apoptotic cell death. Further, unlike numerous  cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs which induce apoptosis by activating  p53-dependent pathways, tachpyridine-mediated cell death did not require  p53 activation. Although immunoblotting revealed rapid accumulation of  p53 following treatment with tachpyridine, p21(WAF1) was not induced.  Further, neither cytotoxicity nor apoptosis required p53. p53 null human  lung cancer H1299 cells transfected with an ecdysone-inducible p53  exhibited equivalent sensitivity to tachpyridine in the presence and  absence of p53, demonstrating the lack of requirement for p53 in an  isogenic cell system. Further, time-lapse video microscopy and TUNEL  assays demonstrated that both p53 null and p53 wildtype cells underwent  apoptotic cell death in response to tachpyridine. In addition, in 55  human cancer cell lines the mean GI(50) of tachpyridine in cells with  mutant p53 was virtually identical to the GI(50) in cells with wild-type  p53. These results demonstrate that tachpyridine initiates an apoptotic  mode of cell death that does not require functional p53. Since over 50\textbackslash\%  of human tumors contain a functionally defective p53 that reduces  sensitivity to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, such as etoposide  and cisplatin, the ability of tachpyridine to induce apoptosis  independently of p53 may offer an advantage in antitumor therapy.\}},

  abstract = {Iron chelators have traditionally been used in the treatment of iron overload. Recently, chelators have also been explored for their ability to limit oxidant damage in cardiovascular, neurologic, and inflammatory disease as well as to serve as anti-cancer agents. To determine the mechanism of cell death induced by iron chelators, we assessed the time course and pathways of caspase activation during apoptosis induced by iron chelators. We report that the chelator tachpyridine sequentially activates caspases 9, 3, and 8. These caspases were also activated by the structurally unrelated chelators dipyridyl and desferrioxamine. The critical role of caspase activation in cell death was supported by micro-injection experiments demonstrating that p35, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, protected HeLa cells from chelator-induced cell death. Apoptosis mediated by tachpyridine was not prevented by blocking the CD95 death receptor pathway with a Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) dominant-negative mutant. In contrast, chelator-mediated cell death was blocked in cells microinjected with Bcl-XL and completely inhibited in cells microinjected with a dominant-negative caspase 9 expression vector. Caspase activation was not observed in cells treated with N-methyl tachpyridine, an N-alkylated derivative of tachpyridine which lacks an ability to react with iron. These results suggest that activation of a mitochondrial caspase pathway is an important mechanism by which iron chelators induce cell death.},

  abstract = {N-Nitroso compounds are found in the colon and are formed endogenously because amines and amides are produced by bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids in the large gut. They can be N-nitrosated in the presence of a nitrosating agent. To test the hypothesis that increased nitrogenous residues from red meat would increase endogenous N-nitrosation, thus accounting for the epidemiologic association between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer, we fed increased levels of red meat and measured apparent total N-nitroso compounds (ATNCs) in fecal samples in a series of studies of volunteers maintained under controlled conditions. A result of these studies is that we have shown a consistent dose response to red meat consumption. Fiber, in the form of vegetables, bran or resistant starch, does not reduce the level of ATNCs formed, although transit time is reduced and fecal weight are increased. Here we show that the equivalent amount (420-600 g) of meat as white meat has no effect on fecal ATNCs in 12 volunteers (P = 0.338). At dosages of 0, 60, 120, 240 and 420 g of red meat/d, mean levels of ATNC output are highly correlated with dose of meat: for concentration ATNC versus dose of meat in g/d, r = 0.972, beta = 0.252 ng/g (SE 0.035); for total ATNC output versus dose of meat in g/d, r = 0.963, beta = 2.605 mug/d (SE 0.419). The effects of nonmeat protein and of heme on increased N-nitrosation and the genotoxic effects of the ATNCs produced are presently being investigated.},

  abstract = {Ferritin is a ubiquitous intracellular iron storage protein that consists of 24 subunits of the H and L type. The ability to sequester iron from participation in oxygen free radical formation is consistent with a cytoprotective role for ferritin. Here we demonstrate that ferritins H and L are induced in cells treated with beta-napthoflavone (beta-NF) and chemopreventive dithiolethiones. Induction of ferritin H by beta-NF and the dithiolethiones oltipraz and 1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) occurs via a transcriptional mechanism that is mediated by the ferritin H electrophile/antioxidant-responsive element (EpRE/ARE). The murine ferritin H gene contains five potential xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) sequences in its 5'-promoter region. However, deletion analysis demonstrates that these XRE sequences are not functional in inducing ferritin H in response to beta-NF. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that the ferritin H EpRE/ARE binds Nrf2. Transfection of chimeric ferritin H reporter genes with Nrf2 expression vectors and Nrf2 dominant-negative mutants indicate that Nrf2 functions at the EpRE/ARE to mediate transcriptional activation of ferritin H. Induction of ferritin H and L was not seen in Nrf2 knockout cells, demonstrating that this transcription factor is required for the induction of ferritin in response to polycyclic aromatic xenobiotics and chemopreventive agents. Nrf2 may also play a role in basal transcription of both ferritin H and L. These results provide a mechanistic link between regulation of the iron storage protein ferritin and the cancer chemopreventive response.},

  abstract = {Iron (Fe) chelators induce a G(1)/S arrest and several of these are undergoing clinical trials as anticancer agents. Despite this, little is known concerning the precise function of Fe in cell cycle progression and the role of p53 in this process. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of Fe chelators on p53 and the mechanism involved in the chelator-mediated increase in mRNA levels of the universal cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1). Cells were incubated with the potent Fe chelator 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311) and the results compared with those from cells treated with actinomycin D (Act D), which induces p53. Following incubation with 311, a 3- to 5-fold increase in nuclear p53 protein was observed in cells with wild-type p53. In addition, 311 increased p53 DNA-binding activity 2-fold, while Act D increased it 3- to 5-fold in cells with native p53. To determine the role of p53 in WAF1 transcription, a reporter construct was used consisting of a WAF1 promoter containing the p53-binding site. In cells with wild-type p53, chelators had no effect on luciferase activity, while the positive control, Act D, caused a significant increase. Hence, despite increased p53 protein expression and p53 DNA-binding activity following chelation, these latter results suggested it had no role in up-regulating WAF1 mRNA. Our experiments demonstrated: (i) that the elevated WAF1 mRNA expression after Fe chelation was due to increased transcription and also to a post-transcriptional mechanism that was sensitive to cycloheximide; and (ii) that Fe-chelation increased WAF1 expression through a p53-independent pathway.},

Pathogenic mutations in ferroportin I lead to an autosomal dominant hereditary iron overload syndrome characterized by high serum ferritin concentration, normal transferrin saturation, iron accumulation predominantly in macrophages, and marginal anemia. Iron overload occurs in both the African and the African-American populations, but a possible genetic basis has not been established. We analyzed the ferroportin I gene in 19 unrelated patients from southern Africa (N = 15) and the United States (N = 4) presenting with primary iron overload. We found a new c. 744 C--{$>$}T (Q248H) mutation in the SLC40A1 gene in 4 of these patients (3 Africans and I African-American). Among 22 first degree family members, 10 of whom were Q248H heterozygotes, the mutation was associated with a trend to higher serum ferritin to amino aspartate transferase ratios (means of 14.8 versus 4.3 mug/U; P = 0.1) and lower hemoglobin concentrations (means of 11.8 versus 13.2 g/dL; P = 0.1). The ratio corrects serum ferritin concentration for alcohol-induced hepatocellular damage. We also found heterozygosity for the Q248H mutation in 7 of 51 (14\%) southern African community control participants selected because they had a serum ferritin concentration below 400 mug/L and in 5 of 100 (5\%) anonymous African-Americans, but we did not find the change in 300 Caucasians with normal iron status and 25 Caucasians with non-HFE iron overload. The hemoglobin concentration was significantly lower in the African community controls with the Q248H mutation than in those without it. We conclude that the Q248H mutation is a common polymorphism in the ferroportin I gene in African populations that may be associated with mild anemia and a tendency to iron loading.

  abstract = {Background \& Aims: Iron overload may be carcinogenic. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are reportedly at a 20-200-fold risk of intrahepatic cancer, but the reported risks for nonhepatobiliary cancers are conflicting. The risk of cancer in heterozygous individuals (estimated allele frequency, 1/10 to 1/20) is unknown. This study aimed to better assess these risks. Methods: We performed a population-based cohort study of 1847 Swedish patients with HH and 5973 of their first-degree relatives using nationwide, population-based health and census registers. We used standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) as relative risk. Results: With 62 liver cancers and 128 nonhepatobiliary cancers, patients with HH were at a 20-fold risk of liver cancer (SIR, 21; 95\% confidence interval [Cl], 16-22) but an almost unaltered risk of all other cancers (SIR, 1.2; 95\% Cl, 1.0-1.4), including nonelevated risks for several gastrointestinal tract cancers. At 10 years of follow-up, the absolute risk of liver cancer was 6\% among men and 1.5\% among women. With 21 liver cancers and 508 nonhepatobiliary cancers, first-degree relatives were at an unaltered risk of extrahepatic cancer (SIR, 1.0; 95\% Cl, 0.9-1.1, including unelevated risks for gastrointestinal cancers) but at a modest and historic increased risk of hepatobiliary cancer (SIR, 1.5; 95\% Cl, 1.0-2.4), the histopathologic spectrum of which differed from the patients. Conclusions: Patients (particularly men) with HH are at increased risk for hepatocellular cancer, although the magnitude of the risk is lower than previous estimates. Overall cancer risk in first-degree relatives does not seem to be increased.},

Because overexpression of endogenous transferrin receptor (TfR) has been qualitatively described for various cancers and is presumably due to malignant transformation of cells, TfR may represent a suitable target for application of molecular imaging technologies to increase detection of smaller tumors. In the work reported here, investigation into the biology of this receptor using electron microscopy has demonstrated that iron oxide particles targeted to TfR are internalized and accumulate in lysosomal vesicles within cells. Biochemical analysis of the interaction of imaging probes with cells overexpressing the TfR demonstrated that the extent of accumulation, and therefore probe efficacy, is dependent on the nature of the chemical cross-link between transferrin and the iron oxide particle. These data were utilized to design and synthesize an improved imaging probe. Experiments demonstrate that the novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe is sensitive enough to detect small differences in endogenous TfR expression in human cancer cell lines. Quantitative measurement of TfR overexpression in a panel of 27 human breast cancer patients demonstrated that 74\% of patient cancer tissues overexpressed the TfR and that the sensitivity of the new imaging agent was suitable to detect TfR overexpression in greater than 40\% of these cases. Based on a biochemical and cell biological approach, these studies have resulted in the synthesis and development of an improved MRI probe with the best in vitro and in vivo imaging properties reported to date.},

  abstract = {Two general pathways for cell death have been defined, apoptosis and necrosis. Previous studies in Jurkat cells have demonstrated that the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) is required for Fas-mediated signaling to apoptosis and necrosis. Here we developed L929rTA cell lines that allow Tet-on inducible expression and FK506-binding protein ( FKBP)-mediated dimerization of FADD, FADD-death effector domain (FADD-DED), or FADD-death domain (FADD-DD). We show that expression and dimerization of FADD leads to necrosis. However, pretreatment of the cells with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, which leads to proteasome-mediated degradation of receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1), reverts FKBP-FADD-induced necrosis to apoptosis. Expression and dimerization of FADD-DD mediates necrotic cell death. We found that FADD-DD is able to bind RIP1, another protein necessary for Fas-mediated necrosis. Expression and dimerization of FADD-DED initiates apoptosis. Remarkably, in the presence of caspase inhibitors, FADD-DED mediates necrotic cell death. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed that FADD-DED in the absence procaspase-8 C/A is also capable of recruiting RIP1. However, when procaspase-8 C/A and RIP1 are expressed simultaneously, FADD-DED preferentially recruits procaspase-8 C/A.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the prospective association of serum iron, copper, and zinc with cancer mortality. METHODS: The study sample included 3000 men and 3244 women free from cancer at baseline who participated in the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Vital status at follow-up was identified by the Social Security Administration's death file and the National Death Index. iron, transferrin saturation (TS), copper, and zinc were categorized into 4 levels using the 10(th), 50(th), and 90(th) percentiles for cutoffs. Relative risks (RRs) were derived from the proportional hazard models after adjustment for a number of potential confounders. RESULTS: Three hundred seven cancer deaths (ICD-9 140-195, 199-208) were identified during 83,664.4 person-years of follow-up. Cancer mortality per 1000 person-years was 3.7 (4.7 for men and 2.8 for women). For men and women combined, the adjusted RRs (95\% confidence intervals, CI) for the four levels were 0.96 (0.57-1.61), 1.00 (reference), 1.12 (0.80-1.58), 1.86 (1.07-3.22) for iron; 0.97 (0.56-1.70), 1.00 (reference), 1.36 (0.99-1.87), 1.82 (1.10-3.02) for TS; 0.76 (0.44-1.31), 1.00 (reference), 1.10 (0.77-1.58), 1.89 (1.07-3.32) for copper; and 0.75 (0.50-1.13), 1.00 (reference), 0.64 (0.47-0.88), 0.84 (0.53-1.33) for zinc. When the exposures were analyzed as continuous variables, the adjusted RRs (CI) were 1.66 (1.03-2.68) for 100 mug/dl iron increase, 1.17 (1.01-1.36) for 10\% TS increase, 1.98 (1.12-3.50) for 100 mug/dl copper increase, and 0.57 (0.16-1.96) for 100 mug/dl zinc increase. Sex differences in the adjusted RRs for iron, TS, and copper were suggestive. CONCLUSION: People with higher serum iron, TS, or copper concentrations had an increased risk of dying from cancer.

Objectives: One of the postulated mechanisms linking red meat intake to cancer risk involves iron. Epidemiologic studies attempt to investigate the association between heme iron intake and cancer by applying a standard factor to total iron from meat. However, laboratory studies suggest that heme iron levels in meat vary according to cooking method and doneness level. We measured heme iron in meats cooked by different cooking methods to a range of doneness levels to use in conjunction with a food frequency questionnaire to estimate heme iron intake. Methods: Composite meat samples were made to represent each meat type, cooking method and doneness level. Heme iron was measured using atomic absorption spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Results: Steak and hamburgers contained the highest levels of heme iron, pork and chicken thigh meat had slightly lower levels, and chicken breast meat had the lowest. Conclusions: Although heme iron levels varied, there was no clear effect of cooking method or doneness level. We outline the methods used to create a heme iron database to be used in conjunction with food frequency questionnaires to estimate heme iron intake in relation to disease outcome.},

  abstract = {Hepatocarcinoma cells (TLT) were incubated in the presence of ascorbate and menadione, either alone or in combination. Cell death was only observed when such compounds were added simultaneously, most probably due to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated by ascorbate-driven menadione redox cycling. TLT cells were particularly sensitive to such an oxidative stress due to its poor antioxidant status. DNA strand breaks were induced by this association but this process did not correspond to oligosomal DNA fragmentation (a hallmark of cell death by apoptosis). Neither caspase-3-like DEVDase activity, nor processing of procaspase-3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were observed in the presence of ascorbate and menadione. Cell death induced by such an association was actively dependent on protein phosphorylation since it was totally prevented by preincubating cells with sodium orthovanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Finally, while H2O2, when administered as a bolus, strongly enhances a constitutive basal NF-kappaB activity in TLT cells, their incubation in the presence of ascorbate and menadione results in a total abolition of such a constitutive activity.},

Tachpyridine induces  apoptosis in cultured cancer cells by triggering a mitochondrial pathway  of cell death that is p53-independent. To explore the relationship  between the chelation chemistry of tachpyridine and its biological  activity, a sensitive and specific reversed-phase high-performance  liquid chromatography (R-P-HPLC) method was devised and used to measure  tachpyr and its metal complexes in cells and tissue culture media. Major  species identified in cells treated with tachpyr were tachpyr itself,  \{[\}Zn(tachpyr)](2+), and iron coordinated to two partially oxidized  species of tachpyridine, \{[\}Fe(tachpyr-ox-2)](2+), and  \{[\}Fe(tachpyr-ox-4)](2+). The kinetics of intracellular accumulation of  \{[\}Zn(tachpyr)](2+) and \{[\}Fe(tachpyr-ox-2)](2+) were markedly  different: \{[\}Zn(tachpyr)](2+) rapidly reached plateau levels, whereas  intracellular levels of \{[\}Fe(tachpyr-ox-2)]2+ and free tachpyr rose  steadily. At the last timepoint measured, 9\textbackslash\% of total cellular iron and  13\textbackslash\% of total cellular zinc were bound by tachpyridine. Taken together,  \{[\}Zn(tachpyr)](2+), \{[\}Fe(tachpyr-ox-2)](2+), and free tachpyr  accounted for virtually all of the tachpyr added, indicating that iron  and zinc are the principal metals targeted by tachpyridine in cells.  Consistent with these findings, activation of the apoptotic caspases 9  and 3 was blocked in cells pre-treated with either iron or zinc.  Pretreatment with either of these metals also completely protected cells  from the cytotoxic effects of tachpyridine. These results demonstrate a  link between metal depletion and chelator cytotoxicity, and suggest that  intracellular chelation of zinc as well as iron may play a role in the  cytotoxicity of tachpyridine.

Among the first targets of activated caspases are the permeabilized mitochondria themselves, leading to disruption of electron transport, loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Deltapsim), decline in ATP levels, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and loss of mitochondrial structural integrity. Here, we identify NDUFS1, the 75 kDa subunit of respiratory complex 1, as a critical caspase substrate in the mitochondria. Cells expressing a noncleavable mutant of p75 sustain Deltapsim and ATP levels during apoptosis, and ROS production in response to apoptotic stimuli is dampened. While cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation are unaffected by the noncleavable p75 mutant, mitochondrial morphology of dying cells is maintained, and loss of plasma membrane integrity is delayed. Therefore, caspase cleavage of NDUFS1 is required for several mitochondrial changes associated with apoptosis.},

  abstract = {Although iron is required to sustain life, its free concentration and metabolism have to be tightly regulated(1). This is achieved through a variety of iron-binding proteins including transferrin and ferritin(2). During infection, bacteria acquire much of their iron from the host by synthesizing siderophores that scavenge iron and transport it into the pathogen(3,4). We recently demonstrated that enterochelin, a bacterial catecholate siderophore, binds to the host protein lipocalin 2 (ref. 5). Here, we show that this event is pivotal in the innate immune response to bacterial infection. Upon encountering invading bacteria the Toll-like receptors on immune cells stimulate the transcription, translation and secretion of lipocalin 2; secreted lipocalin 2 then limits bacterial growth by sequestrating the iron-laden siderophore. Our finding represents a new component of the innate immune system and the acute phase response to infection.},

  abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha is a cytokine capable of inducing caspase-dependent (apoptotic) cell death in some cells and caspase-independent (necrosis-like) cell death in others. Here, using a mutagenesis screen for genes critical in TNF-induced death in L929 cells, we have found that H-ferritin deficiency is responsible for TNF resistance in a mutant line and that, upon treatment with TNF, this line fails to elevate levels of labile iron pool (LIP), critical for TNF-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ROS-dependent cell death. Since we found that TNF-induced LIP in L929 cells is primarily furnished by intracellular storage iron, the lesser induction of LIP in H-ferritin-deficient cells results from a reduction of intracellular iron storage caused by less H-ferritin. Different from some other cell lines, the H-ferritin gene in L929 cells is not TNF inducible; however, when H-ferritin is expressed in L929 cells under a TNF-inducible system, the TNF-induced LIP and subsequent ROS production and cell death were all prevented. Thus, LIP is a common denominator of ferritin both in the enhancement of cell death by basal steady-state H-ferritin and in protection against cell death by induced H-ferritin, thereby acting as a key determinant of TNF-induced cell death.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Having previously shown that the binding of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) protects this extracellular matrix remodeling enzyme from autodegradation, we hypothesized that the addition of NGAL to breast cancer cells, which do not express this protein but do express MMP-9, might result in a more aggressive phenotype in vivo. Based on our previous reports that MMPs can be detected in the urine of cancer patients, we also asked whether MMP-9/NGAL could be detected in the urine of breast cancer patients and whether it might be predictive of disease status. Experimental Design: Clones of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells differentially expressing NGAL were generated by stable transfection with human NGAL expression constructs. The established clones were then implanted s.c. in immunodeficient mice and tumor growth was monitored. In addition, we analyzed the urine of individuals with breast cancer and age-matched, sex-matched controls using gelatin zymography for the presence of MMP-9/NGAL. Results: Increased NGAL expression resulted in significant stimulation of tumor growth. Immunohistochemical analysis of MCF-7 tumors revealed that the NGAL-overexpressing ones exhibited increased growth rates that were accompanied by increased levels of MMP-9, increased angiogenesis, and an increase in the tumor cell proliferative fraction. In addition, MMP-9/NGAL complex was detected in 86.36\% of the urine samples from breast cancer patients but not in those from healthy age and sex-matched controls. Conclusions: These findings suggest, for the first time, that NGAL may play an important role in breast cancer in vivo by protecting MMP-9 from degradation thereby enhancing its enzymatic activity and facilitating angiogenesis and tumor growth. Clinically, these data suggest that the urinary detection of MMP-9/NGAL may be useful in noninvasively predicting disease status of breast cancer patients.},

Our goals here were to test whether ascorbate killed cancer cells selectively, and if so, to determine mechanisms, using clinically relevant conditions. Cell death in 10 cancer and 4 normal cell types was measured by using 1-h exposures. Normal cells were unaffected by 20 mM ascorbate, whereas 5 cancer lines had EC50 values of {$<$} 4 mM, a concentration easily achievable i.v.Human lymphoma cells were studied in detail because of their sensitivity to ascorbate (EC50 of 0.5 mM) and suitability for addressing mechanisms. Extracellular but not intracellular ascorbate mediated cell death, which occurred by apoptosis and pyknosis/necrosis. Cell death was independent of metal chelators and absolutely dependent on H2O2 formation. Cell death from H2O2 added to cells was identical to that found when H2O2 was generated by ascorbate treatment. H2O2 generation was dependent on ascorbate concentration, incubation time, and the presence of 0.5-10\% serum, and displayed a linear relationship with ascorbate radical formation. Although ascorbate addition to medium generated H2O2, ascorbate addition to blood generated no detectable H2O2 and only trace detectable ascorbate radical. Taken together, these data indicate that ascorbate at concentrations achieved only by i.v. administration may be a pro-drug for formation of H2O2, and that blood can be a delivery system of the pro-drug to tissues. These findings give plausibility to i.v. ascorbic acid in cancer treatment, and have unexpected implications for treatment of infections where H2O2 may be beneficial.},

  abstract = {NGAL (human neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and its mouse analogue 24p3 are members of the lipocalin family of small secreted proteins. These proteins are up-regulated in a number of pathological conditions, including cancers, and may function as transporters of essential factors. Although previous publications have suggested that 24p3 has pro-apoptotic functions, other data are more suggestive of a survival function. The current study was designed to determine whether NGAL is pro- or anti-apoptotic. Apoptosis induced in human adenocarcinoma A549 cells by the 5-lipoxygenase-activating-protein inhibitor MK886, or several celecoxib-derived PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) inhibitors that are devoid of cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitory activity, was accompanied by a dose- and time-dependent increase of NGAL mRNA levels, as was reported previously with 24p3. A similar induction of NGAL mRNA was observed in human breast cancer MCF7 cells treated with MK886, indicating this was not a cell-specific effect. Treatment of A549 cells with up to 150 mu g/10(6) cells of purified recombinant NGAL protein had no effect on viability, whereas antisera against the full-length NGAL protein induced apoptosis in these cells. The stable overexpression of NGAL in A549 cells had no effect on proliferation or viability. However, the cell death induced by a PDK1 inhibitor was reduced by 50\% in NGAL-overexpressing cells. Decreasing NGAL mRNA and protein expression with siRNA (small interfering RNA) in A549 cells increased the toxicity of a PDK1 inhibitor by approx. 45\%. These data indicate that, although the induction of NGAL correlates with apoptosis, this induction represents a survival response. Because NGAL is a secreted protein, it may play an extracellular role in cell defence against toxicants and/or facilitate the survival of the remaining cells.},

Here we report cloning of the 24p3 cell-surface receptor (24p3R). Ectopic 24p3R expression confers on cells the ability to undergo either iron uptake or apoptosis, dependent upon the iron content of the ligand: Iron-loaded 24p3 increases intracellular iron concentration without promoting apoptosis; iron-lacking 24p3 decreases intracellular iron levels, which induces expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim, resulting in apoptosis. Intracellular iron delivery blocks Bim induction and suppresses apoptosis due to 24p3 addition or IL-3 deprivation. We find, unexpectedly, that the BCR-ABL oncoprotein activates expression of 24p3 and represses 24p3R expression, rendering BCR-ABL(+) cells refractory to secreted 24p3. By inhibiting BCR-ABL, imatinib induces 24p3R expression and, consequently, apoptosis. Our results reveal an unanticipated role for intracellular iron regulation in an apoptotic pathway relevant to BCR-ABL-induced myeloproliferative disease and its treatment.},

We have reported previously that Vpr also induces apoptosis independently of G(2)/M arrest in human HeLa cells. By contrast, Vpr does not induce G(2)/M arrest in rodent cells, but it retards cell growth. To clarify the relationship between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we expressed Vpr endogenously in rodent cells and investigated cell cycle profiles and apoptosis. We show here that Vpr induces cell cycle arrest at the G, phase and apoptosis in rodent cells. Vpr increased the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9, but not of caspase-8. Moreover, Vpr-induced apoptosis could be inhibited by inhibitors of caspase-3 and caspase-9, but not by inhibitor of caspase-8. We also showed that Vpr induces the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol and disrupts the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Finally, we showed that apoptosis occurred in HeLa cells through an identical pathway. These results suggest that disruption of mitochondrial functions by Vpr induces apoptosis via cell cycle arrest at G(1), but that apoptosis is independent of G(2)/M arrest. Furthermore, it appears that Vpr acts species-specifically with respect to induction of cell cycle arrest but not of apoptosis. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background and aims: Total body iron and high dietary iron intake are risk factors for colorectal cancer. To date there is no comprehensive characterisation of iron transport proteins in progression to colorectal carcinoma. In this study, we examined expression of iron import (duodenal cytochrome b (DCYTB), divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1)) and export (hephaestin (HEPH) and ferroportin (FPN)) proteins in colorectal carcinoma. Methods: Perl's staining was used to examine colonocyte iron content. Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting were used to examine mRNA and protein levels of the molecules of interest in 11 human colorectal cancers. Semiquantitative immunohistochemistry was used to verify protein levels and information on cellular localisation. The effect of iron loading on E-cadherin expression in SW480 and Caco-2 cell lines was examined by promoter assays, real time PCR and western blotting. Results: Perl's staining showed increased iron in colorectal cancers, and there was a corresponding overexpression of components of the intracellular iron import machinery ( DCYTB, DMT1, and TfR1). The iron exporter FPN was also overexpressed, but its intracellular location, combined with reduced HEPH levels, suggests reduced iron efflux in the majority of colorectal cancers examined. Loss of HEPH and FPN expression was associated with more advanced disease. Iron loading Caco-2 and SW480 cells caused cellular proliferation and E-cadherin repression. Conclusions: Progression to colorectal cancer is associated with increased expression in iron import proteins and a block in iron export due to decreased expression and aberrant localisation of HEPH and FPN, respectively. This results in increased intracellular iron which may induce proliferation and repress cell adhesion.},

In spite of the good clinical response to first-line therapy, complete eradication of NB cells is rarely achieved. Thus, new therapeutic strategies are needed to eradicate surviving NB cells and prevent relapse. Sodium ascorbate has been recently reported to induce apoptosis of B16 melanoma cells through down-regulation of the transferrin receptor, CD71. Since NB and melanoma share the same embryologic neuroectodermal origin, we used different human NB cell lines to assess whether the same findings occurred. Results: We could observe dose- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis in all NB cell lines. Sodium ascorbate decreased the expression of CD71 and caused cell death within 24 h. An increase in the global and specific caspase activity took place, as well as an early loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Moreover, intracellular iron was significantly decreased after exposure to sodium ascorbate. Apoptotic markers were reverted when the cells were pretreated with the iron donor ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), further confirming that iron depletion is responsible for the ascorbate-induced cell death in NB cells. Conclusion: Sodium ascorbate is highly toxic to neuroblastoma cell lines and the specific mechanism of vitamin C-induced apoptosis is due to a perturbation of intracellular iron levels ensuing TfR-downregulation.},

  abstract = {Background Blood transfusions may influence the recipients' cancer risks both through transmission of biologic agents and by modulation of the immune system. However, cancer occurrence in transfusion recipients remains poorly characterized. Methods We used computerized files from Scandinavian blood banks to identify a cohort of 888843 cancer-free recipients transfused after 1968. The recipients were followed from first registered transfusion until the date of death, emigration, cancer diagnosis, or December 31, 2002, whichever came first. Relative risks were expressed as ratios of the observed to the expected numbers of cancers, that is, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), using incidence rates for the general Danish and Swedish populations as a reference. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results During 5652918 person-years of follow-up, 80990 cancers occurred in the transfusion recipients, corresponding to a SIR of 1.45 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44 to 1.46). The SIR for cancer overall decreased from 5.36 (95\% CI = 5.29 to 5.43) during the first 6 months after transfusion to 1.10 or less for follow-up periods more than 2 years after the transfusion. However, the standardized incidence ratios for cancers of the tongue, mouth, pharynx, esophagus, liver, and respiratory and urinary tracts and for squamous cell skin carcinoma remained elevated beyond 10 years after the transfusion. Conclusions The marked increase in cancer risk shortly after a blood transfusion may reflect the presence of undiagnosed occult cancers with symptoms that necessitated the blood transfusion. The continued increased risk of tobacco- and alohol-related cancers suggests that lifestyle and other risk factors related to conditions prompting transfusion rather than transfusion-related exposures per se are important to the observed cancer occurrence in the recipients.},

  abstract = {There is an emerging body of evidence implicating iron in carcinogenesis and in particular colorectal cancer, but whether this involves Wnt signalling, a major oncogenic signalling pathway has not been studied. We aimed to determine the effect of iron loading on Wnt signalling using mutant APC (Caco-2 and SW480) and wild-type APC (HEK-293 and human primary. broblasts) containing cell lines. Elevating cellular iron levels in Caco-2 and SW480 cells caused increased Wnt signalling as indicated by increased TOPFLASH reporter activity, increased mRNA expression of two known targets, c-myc and Nkd1, and increased cellular proliferation. In contrast wild-type APC and beta-catenin-containing lines, HEK-293 and human primary. broblasts were not responsive to iron loading. This was verified in SW480 cells that no longer induced iron-mediated Wnt signalling when transfected with wild-type APC. The cell line LS174T, wild type for APC but mutant for beta-catenin, was also responsive suggesting that the role of iron is to regulate beta-catenin. Furthermore, we show that E-cadherin status has no influence on iron-mediated Wnt signalling. We thus speculate that excess iron could exacerbate tumorigenesis in the background of APC loss, a common finding in cancers.},

  abstract = {Background: We tested the hypothesis that 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP, Triapine(R)) may enhance response to re-treatment with gemcitabine by enhancing intracellular uptake of gemcitabine in a phase II study. Method: Patients who had prior exposure to gemcitabine as a first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were given weekly infusions of 3-AP and gemcitabine for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest, repeated every 28 days. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected to evaluate the effect of 3-AP on pharmacokinetics and intracellular uptake of gemcitabine. Result: Twelve patients were treated with a median of two treatment cycles without objective response, hence the study was terminated at interim analysis. Four patients had stable disease and the median time to progression was 3 months (95\% confidence interval, CI: 1.7 to 9.1 months). Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (two patients), hypoxia (three patients) and dyspnea (one patient). Four patients developed reversible symptomatic methemoglobinemia during 3-AP infusion, with mild to moderately elevated methemoglobin levels that ranged from 7.8 to 17.6\% of the total hemoglobin concentration. Limited pharmacokinetic data did not suggest any clinically relevant pharmacological influence of 3-AP on gemcitabine. Conclusion: 3-AP did not enhance clinical response to gemcitabine in this cohort of patients with prior exposure to gemcitabine for advanced NSCLC. Further development of 3-AP in lung cancer is challenged by its potential of causing methemoglobinemia and hypoxia, which could be problematic in patients with compromised pulmonary reserves.},

Erastin, a previously reported compound with RAS-selective lethality, showed similar properties.

RSL3 activated a similar death mechanism but in a VDAC-independent manner. We found that cells transformed with oncogenic RAS have increased iron content relative to their normal cell counterparts through upregulation of transferrin receptor 1 and downregulation of ferritin heavy chain 1 and ferritin light chain.},

  abstract = {Background Excess iron has been implicated in cancer risk through increased iron-catalyzed free radical-mediated oxidative stress. Methods A multicenter randomized, controlled, single-blinded clinical trial (VA Cooperative Study \#410) tested the hypothesis that reducing iron stores by phlebotomy would influence vascular outcomes in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Patients without a visceral malignancy in the last 5 years (n=1277) were randomly assigned to control (n=641) or iron reduction (n=636). Occurrence of new visceral malignancy and cause-specific mortality data were collected prospectively. Cancer and mortality outcomes in the two arms were compared using intent-to-treat analysis with a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Statistical tests were two-sided. Results Patients were followed up for an average of 4.5 years. Ferritin levels were similar in both groups at baseline but were lower in iron reduction patients than control patients across all 6-month visits (mean=79.7 ng/mL, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=73.8 to 85.5 ng/mL vs 122.5 ng/mL, 95\% CI = 115.5 to 129.5 ng/mL; P {$<$}.001). Risk of new visceral malignancy was lower in the iron reduction group than in the control group (38 vs 60, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65, 95\% CI = 0.43 to 0.97; P=.036), and, among patients with new cancers, those in the iron reduction group had lower cancer-specific and all-cause mortality (HR = 0.39, 95\% CI = 0.21 to 0.72; P =.003; and HR = 0.49, 95\% CI = 0.29 to 0.83; P =.009, respectively) than those in the control group. Mean ferritin levels across all 6-monthly visits were similar in patients in the iron reduction and control groups who developed cancer but were lower among all patients who did not develop cancer than among those who did (76.4 ng/mL,95\% CI = 71.4 to 81.4 ng/mL, vs 127.1 ng/mL, 95\% CI = 71.2 to 183.0 ng/mL; P =.017).

Heme iron is absorbed by different mechanisms than non-heme iron, but despite considerable study over many years these mechanisms remain poorly understood. This review provides an overview of the importance of heme iron in the diet and discusses the two prevailing hypotheses of heme absorption; namely receptor mediated endocytosis of heme, and direct transport into the intestinal enterocyte by recently discovered heme transporters. A specific emphasis is placed on the questions surrounding the site of heme catabolism and the identity of the enzyme that performs this task. Additionally, we present the hypothesis that a non-heme iron transport protein may be required for heme iron absorption and discuss the experiences of our laboratory in examining this hypothesis.

  abstract = {Iron plays an essential role in cell proliferation and is a required cofactor for a number of critical cellular enzymes. In this report we investigate changes in proteins of iron metabolism during p53-mediated replicative arrest. Following the induction of p53 in H1299 lung cancer cells containing a doxycycline-inducible p53, an increase in both H and L subunits of ferritin protein was observed. To determine the mechanism of this effect, we investigated the ability of p53 to regulate ferritin. Real time reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated no difference in levels of ferritin H mRNA in the presence and absence of p53. Because these results suggested that transcriptional mechanisms were not responsible for the p53-dependent increase in ferritin, we tested whether a post-transcriptional mechanism was involved. RNA bandshift assays revealed that induction of p53 decreased iron regulatory protein binding. Consistent with this observation, Western blot analysis revealed a decline in transferrin receptor 1 protein levels following induction of p53. Collectively, these results suggest that p53 may induce cell cycle arrest not only by well described mechanisms involving the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors but also by the recruitment of pathways that reduce the availability of intracellular iron.},

  abstract = {Objectives Exposure to iron fumes and dust and welding fumes is widespread and may increase the risk of lung cancer. The aim of this study was to identify associations between exposure to iron and welding fumes and the incidence of lung cancer among Finnish men. Methods The cohort of all economically active Finnish men, born in 1906-1945, who participated in the national census in 1970 was followed through the Finnish Cancer Registry for lung cancer cases (N=30 137) during 1971-1995. Their census occupations in 1970 were converted to estimates of cumulative exposure to iron and welding fumes with the Finnish job-exposure matrix on the basis of likelihood, average level, and estimated duration of exposure. Relative risk estimates for categorized cumulative exposure were defined by a Poisson regression, adjusted for smoking, socioeconomic status, and exposure to asbestos and silica dust. Results The relative risks for lung cancer increased as the cumulative exposure to iron and welding fumes increased. The relative risks in the highest exposure category was 1.35 [95\% confidence interval (95\% Cl) 1.05-1.73] for iron and 1.15 (95\% CI 0.90-1.46) for welding fumes. The respective relative risks estimated for squamous-cell carcinoma of the lungs were 1.94 (95\% Cl 1.35-2.78) and 1.55 (95\% CI 1.08-2.24). There was no excess risk of small-cell carcinoma in any exposure category. Conclusions Occupational exposure to iron and welding fumes was associated with an increase in lung cancer risk, mainly that of squamous-cell carcinoma. The simultaneous exposure to both of these agents and other potential work-related carcinogens complicates the interpretation of the independent roles of the risk factors.},

Epo activates specific signaling pathways and leads to activation of key transcription factors such as GATA-1, in order to ensure erythroid differentiation. Deregulation leads to a decreased number of red blood cells, a hemoglobin deficiency, thus a limited oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood. Anemia represents a frequent complication in various diseases such as cancer or inflammatory diseases. It reduces both quality of life and prognosis in patients. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was described to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation and cancer related anemia. Blood transfusions and erythroid stimulating agents (ESAs) including human recombinant Epo (rhuEpo) are currently used as efficient treatments. Moreover, the recently described conflicting effects of ESAs in distinct studies require further investigations on the molecular mechanisms involved in TNF alpha-caused anemia. The present study aims to evaluate the current knowledge and the importance of the effect of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFa on erythropoiesis in inflammatory and malignant conditions.

During apoptosis, a mitochondria-specific phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL), interacts with cytochrome c (cyt c) to form a peroxidase complex that catalyzes CL oxidation; this process plays a pivotal role in the mitochondrial stage of the execution of the cell death program. This review is focused on redox mechanisms and essential structural features of cyt c's conversion into a CL-specific peroxidase that represent an interesting and maybe still unique example of a functionally significant ligand change in hemoproteins. Furthermore, specific characteristics of CL in mitochondria-its asymmetric transmembrane distribution and mechanisms of collapse, the regulation of its synthesis, remodeling, and fatty acid composition-are given significant consideration. Finally, new concepts in drug discovery based on the design of mitochondria-targeted inhibitors of cyt c/CL peroxidase and CL peroxidation with antiapoptotic effects are presented.

Objective: We prospectively investigated whether meat type, cooking method, doneness level, and intake of specific meat mutagens and heme iron are associated with lung carcinoma. Design: Men (n = 278,380) and women (n = 189,596) from the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study with no history of cancer at baseline were monitored for 8 y. Diet was assessed with a 124-item food-frequency questionnaire. A meat-cooking module was used to estimate the intake of individual heterocyclic amines, benzo(a) pyrene, and heme iron. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% CIs. Results: In a comparison of quintiles 5 with 1 (Q5vsQ1), a high intake of red meat was associated with an increased risk of lung carcinoma in both men (HR(Q5vsQ1): 1.22; 95\% CI: 1.09, 1.38; P for trend = 0.005) and women (HR(Q5vsQ1): 1.13; 95\% CI: 0.97, 1.32; P for trend = 0.05). A high intake of processed meat increased the risk only in men (HR(Q5vsQ1): 1.23; 95\% CI: 1.10, 1.37; P for trend = 0.003). In an analysis stratified by smoking status, we observed a tendency for an increased risk with red meat intake in never smoking men and women; however, the risks were not statistically significant. In a comparison of tertiles 3 and 1 (T3vsT1), the risk of lung carcinoma was associated with intake of well-/very-well-done meat (HR(T3vsT1): 1.20; 95\% CI: 1.07, 1.35; P for trend = 0.002) and the intake of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (HR(Q5vsQ1): 1.20; 95\% CI: 1.04, 1.38; P for trend = 0.04) in men. Heme iron intake increased the risk of lung carcinoma in both men (HR(Q5vsQ1): 1.25; 95\% CI: 1.07, 1.45; P for trend = 0.02) and women (HR(Q5vsQ1): 1.18; 95\% CI: 0.99, 1.42; P for trend = 0.002). Conclusion: We observed a moderate association between meat consumption and lung carcinoma, which might be explained by heme iron intake, high-temperature cooking, and associated mutagens.

Eligibility criteria required Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of zero to two with a life expectancy of {$>$} 3 months; one prior chemotherapy regimen was allowed. Results: Thirty patients were assessable for response and toxicity. Median age was 57 years (range 36-79) and median ECOG PS was one (range 0-2). Thirteen patients had previously been treated with chemotherapy. A total of 130 cycles were administered with a median number of cycles of 3.5 (range 1-8). Mild anaemia (40\%), nausea (22\%) and fatigue (22\%) were commonly reported with G3 and G4 neutropenia documented in 22\% and 22\%, respectively. Overall response rate was 5.9\% (95\% confidence interval 0.2\% to 28.7\%). One patient achieved a partial response, eight had stable disease and 21 progressive disease. Median time to disease progression was 3.9 months. Conclusions: 3-AP Triapine as a single agent, at this dose and schedule, is well tolerated but has only minor activity in the treatment of advanced HNSCC.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence on meat intake and breast cancer is inconsistent, with little research on potentially carcinogenic meat-related exposures. We investigated meat subtypes, cooking practices, meat mutagens, iron, and subsequent breast cancer risk. METHODS: Among 52 158 women (aged 55-74 years) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, who completed a food frequency questionnaire, 1205 invasive breast cancer cases were identified. We estimated meat mutagen and haem iron intake with databases accounting for cooking practices. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) within quintiles of intake. RESULTS: Comparing the fifth to the first quintile, red meat (HR = 1.23; 95\% CI = 1.00-1.51, P trend = 0.22), the heterocyclic amine (HCA), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), (HR = 1.26; 95\% CI = 1.03-1.55; P trend = 0.12), and dietary iron (HR = 1.25; 95\% CI = 1.02-1.52; P trend = 0.03) were positively associated with breast cancer. We observed elevated, though not statistically significant, risks with processed meat, the HCA 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx), mutagenic activity, iron from meat, and haem iron from meat. CONCLUSION: In this prospective study, red meat, MeIQx, and dietary iron elevated the risk of invasive breast cancer, but there was no linear trend in the association except for dietary iron.

  abstract = {Background: Sulfasalazine, a NF-kappaB and x(c)-cystine/glutamate antiport inhibitor, has demonstrated a strong antitumoral potential in preclinical models of malignant gliomas. As it presents an excellent safety profile, we initiated a phase 1/2 clinical study of this anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of recurrent WHO grade 3 and 4 astrocytic gliomas in adults. Methods: 10 patients with advanced recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma (n = 2) or glioblastoma (n = 8) aged 32-62 years were recruited prior to the planned interim analysis of the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to daily doses of 1.5, 3, 4.5, or 6 grams of oral sulfasalazine, and treated until clinical or radiological evidence of disease progression or the development of serious or unbearable side effects. Primary endpoints were the evaluation of toxicities according to the CTCAE v. 3.0, and the observation of radiological tumor responses based on MacDonald criteria. Results: No clinical response was observed. One tumor remained stable for 2 months with sulfasalazine treatment, at the lowest daily dose of the drug. The median progression-free survival was 32 days. Side effects were common, as all patients developed grade 1-3 adverse events (mean: 7.2/patient), four patients developed grade 4 toxicity. Two patients died while on treatment or shortly after its discontinuation. Conclusion: Although the proper influence of sulfasalazine treatment on patient outcome was difficult to ascertain in these debilitated patients with a large tumor burden (median KPS = 50), ISRCTN45828668 was terminated after its interim analysis. This study urges to exert cautiousness in future trials of Sulfasalazine for the treatment of malignant gliomas.},

  abstract = {Transferrin receptor (CD71) is involved in the cellular uptake of iron and is expressed on cells with high proliferation. It may be implicated in promoting the growth of endocrine resistant phenotypes within ER+/luminal-like breast cancer. We used a panel of in vitro cell models of acquired resistance to tamoxifen (TAMR), Faslodex (FASR) or severe oestrogen deprivation (MCF-7X) and the ER+ luminal MCF-7 parental line to determine CD71 mRNA expression and to study transferrin (Tf) effects on in vitro tumour growth and its inhibition. Furthermore, CD71 protein expression was assessed in a well-characterized series of patients with invasive breast carcinoma using tissue microarrays. Our results demonstrated a striking elevation of CD71 in all cell models of acquired resistance. Exogenous Tf significantly promoted growth in MCF-7-X and MCF-7 cells but more so in MCF-7-X; this growth was significantly reduced by Faslodex (FAS) or a phosphoinositide-3 kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Increased CD71 expression was associated with poor NPI score, tumour proliferation, basal CKs, p53, EGFR, HER2, steroid receptor negativity and shortened breast cancer specific survival (P {$<$} 0.001). On multivariate analysis, CD71 was found to be an independent prognostic factor in the ER+ cohort of patients. In conclusion, therapies of current interest in breast cancer (e.g. FAS, PI3K-inhibitors) appear able to partially impact on transferrin/CD71-promoted growth, but further investigation of this important mitogenic mechanism may assist in designing new therapeutic strategies to target highly proliferative, endocrine resistant breast cancers. CD71 appears to be a candidate marker of a subgroup of ER+/luminal-like breast cancer characterised by poor outcome and resistance to tamoxifen.},

  abstract = {Although the relation between red and processed meat intake and colorectal cancer has been reported in several epidemiologic studies, very few investigated the potential mechanisms. This study examined multiple potential mechanisms in a large U. S. prospective cohort with a detailed questionnaire on meat type and meat cooking methods linked to databases for estimating intake of mutagens formed in meats cooked at high temperatures (heterocyclic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), heme iron, nitrate, and nitrite. During 7 years of follow-up, 2,719 colorectal cancer cases were ascertained from a cohort of 300,948 men and women. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) comparing the fifth to the first quintile for both red (HR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.09-1.42; P-trend {$<$} 0.001) and processed meat (HR, 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.32; P-trend = 0.017) intakes indicated an elevated risk for colorectal cancer. The potential mechanisms for this relation include heme iron (HR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 0.99-1.29; P-trend = 0.022), nitrate from processed meats (HR, 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.32; P-trend = 0.001), and heterocyclic amine intake [HR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.34; P-trend {$<$} 0.001 for 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and HR, 1.17; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.29; P-trend {$<$} 0.001 for 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx)]. In general, the elevated risks were higher for rectal cancer than for colon cancer, with the exception of MeIQx and DiMeIQx, which were only associated with colon cancer. In conclusion, we found a positive association for red and processed meat intake and colorectal cancer; heme iron, nitrate/nitrite, and heterocyclic amines from meat may explain these associations.

Scn-Ngal (also known as neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin, siderocalin, lipocalin 2) sequesters bacterial iron chelators, called siderophores, and consequently blocks bacterial growth. However, Scn-Ngal is also prominently expressed in aseptic diseases, implying that it binds additional ligands and serves additional functions. Using chemical screens, crystallography and fluorescence methods, we report that Scn-Ngal binds iron together with a small metabolic product called catechol. The formation of the complex blocked the reactivity of iron and permitted its transport once introduced into circulation in vivo. Scn-Ngal then recycled its iron in endosomes by a pH-sensitive mechanism. As catechols derive from bacterial and mammalian metabolism of dietary compounds, the Scn-Ngal-catechol-Fe(III) complex represents an unforeseen microbial-host interaction, which mimics Scn-Ngal-siderophore interactions but instead traffics iron in aseptic tissues. These results identify an endogenous siderophore, which may link the disparate roles of Scn-Ngal in different diseases.},

Overall median serum ferritin decreased significantly at 1 year (p = 0.002). Decreases occurred irrespective of whether patients were chelation-naive or previously chelated; changes were dependent on dose adjustments and ongoing iron intake. Sustained reductions in labile plasma iron were observed. Discontinuation rate (48.7\%) and adverse event profile were consistent with previously reported deferasirox data in MDS. Alanine aminotransferase levels decreased significantly; change correlated significantly with reduction in serum ferritin (p {$<$} 0.0001).

  abstract = {Accurate analysis of the erythroid lineage is essential in evaluating bone marrow biopsy specimens and can be particularly challenging in the setting of dyserythropoiesis. Transferrin receptor (CD71) mediates the uptake of transferrin-iron complexes and is highly expressed on the surface of cells of the erythroid lineage. Although CD71 has been used for cytometric analysis, its usefulness in paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsy specimens has not been examined. This study defined the immunohistochemical profile of CD71, as compared with glycophorin A (CD235a) and hemoglobin, in 65 bone marrow biopsy specimens, including normal marrow specimens and cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, plasma cell neoplasm, and metastatic carcinoma. Immunoreactivity for CD71 was restricted to erythroid precursors in normal and dyspoietic marrow samples and exhibited a membranous and cytoplasmic staining pattern. The vast majority of mature erythrocytes lack expression of CD71, greatly facilitating interpretation. CD71 is a highly effective marker for the detection of cells of erythroid lineage in bone marrow biopsy specimens.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, several large epidemiologic investigations of meat intake and prostate cancer have been published. Therefore, a meta-analysis of prospective studies was conducted to estimate potential associations between red or processed meat intake and prostate cancer. Fifteen studies of red meat and 11 studies of processed meat were included in the analyses. High vs. low intake and dose-response analyses were conducted using random effects models to generate summary relative risk estimates (SRRE). No association between high vs. low red meat consumption (SRRE = 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.96-1.05) or each 100 g increment of red meat (SRRE = 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.95-1.05) and total prostate cancer was observed. Similarly, no association with red meat was observed for advanced prostate cancer (SRRE = 1.01, 95\% CI: 0.94-1.09). A weakly elevated summary association between processed meat and total prostate cancer was found (SRRE = 1.05, 95\% CI: 0.99-1.12), although heterogeneity was present, the association was attenuated in a sub-group analysis of studies that adjusted for multiple potential confounding factors, and publication bias likely affected the summary effect. In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis are not supportive of an independent positive association between red or processed meat intake and prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {The relationship between meat consumption and breast cancer has been the focus of several epidemiological investigations, yet there has been no clear scientific consensus as to whether red or processed meat intake increases the risk of breast cancer. We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis incorporating data from several recently published prospective studies of red or processed meat intake and breast cancer. In the meta-analysis utilising data from the Pooling Project publication (includes data from eight cohorts) combined with data from nine studies published between 2004 and 2009 and one study published in 1996, the fixed-effect summary relative risk estimate (SRRE) for red meat intake (high v. low) and breast cancer was 1.02 (95\% CI 0.98, 1.07; P value for heterogeneity = 0.001) and the random-effects SRRE was 1.07 (95\% CI 0.98, 1.17). The SRRE for each 100 g increment of red meat was 1.04 (95\% CI 1.00, 1.07), based on a fixed-effects model, and 1.12 (95\% CI 1.03, 1.23) based on a random-effects model. No association was observed for each 100 g increment of red meat among premenopausal women (SRRE 1.01; 95\% CI 0.92, 1.11) but a statistically significant SRRE of 1.22 (95\% CI 1.04, 1.44) was observed among postmenopausal women using a random-effects model. However, the association for postmenopausal women was attenuated and non-significant when using a fixed-effects model (SRRE 1.03; 95\% CI 0.98, 1.08). The fixed-and random-effect SRRE for high (v. low) processed meat intake and breast cancer were 1.00 (95\% CI 0.98, 1.01; P value for heterogeneity = 0.005) and 1.08 (95\% CI 1.01, 1.16), respectively. The fixed-and random-effect SRRE for each 30 g increment of processed meat were 1.03 (95\% CI 1.00, 1.06) and 1.06 (95\% CI 0.99, 1.14), respectively. Overall, weak positive summary associations were observed across all meta-analysis models, with the majority being non-statistically significant. Heterogeneity was evident in most analyses, summary associations were sensitive to the choice of analytical model (fixed v. random effects), and publication bias appeared to have produced slightly elevated summary associations. On the basis of this quantitative assessment, red meat and processed meat intake does not appear to be independently associated with increasing the risk of breast cancer, although further investigations of potential effect modifiers, such as analyses by hormone receptor status, may provide valuable insight to potential patterns of associations.},

  abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide and accounts for one-sixth of cancer deaths in the United States. Breast cancer consists of a heterogeneous group of tumours classified into five types, in which the HER2/neu positive and the basal type (most are ER and HER2 negative) have the worst clinical prognosis. In recent years, prognostic/predictive markers such as ER/PR or HER2/neu have been widely used in the selection of the optimal breast cancer treatments for individual patients, which have been proven to be very effective in disease control. These results suggest that further examination of the molecular mechanisms underlying the breast tumorigenesis and identification of the potential biomarkers in different types of breast cancers will greatly benefit clinical diagnosis and facilitate the design of more effective personalized therapies to increase patient survival. This review aims to summarize recent research findings on lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a newly identified biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer, and the possible mechanisms underlying its role in tumorigenesis and metastasis.

  abstract = {Red meat and processed meat intake is associated with a risk of colorectal cancer, a major cause of death in affluent countries. Epidemiological and experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that heme iron present in meat promotes colorectal cancer. This meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies of colon cancer reporting heme intake included 566,607 individuals and 4,734 cases of colon cancer. The relative risk of colon cancer was 1.18 (95\% CI: 1.06-1.32) for subjects in the highest category of heme iron intake compared with those in the lowest category. Epidemiological data thus show a suggestive association between dietary heme and risk of colon cancer. The analysis of experimental studies in rats with chemically-induced colon cancer showed that dietary hemoglobin and red meat consistently promote aberrant crypt foci, a putative precancer lesion. The mechanism is not known, but heme iron has a catalytic effect on (i) the endogenous formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds and (ii) the formation of cytotoxic and genotoxic aldehydes by lipoperoxidation. A review of evidence supporting these hypotheses suggests that both pathways are involved in heme iron toxicity. Cancer Prev Res; 4(2); 177-84. (C)2011 AACR.},

  abstract = {Ferroportin and hepcidin are critical proteins for the regulation of systemic iron homeostasis. Ferroportin is the only known mechanism for export of intracellular non-heme-associated iron; its stability is regulated by the hormone hepcidin. Although ferroportin profoundly affects concentrations of intracellular iron in tissues important for systemic iron absorption and trafficking, ferroportin concentrations in breast cancer and their influence on growth and prognosis have not been examined. We demonstrate here that both ferroportin and hepcidin are expressed in cultured human breast epithelial cells and that hepcidin regulates ferroportin in these cells. Further, ferroportin protein is substantially reduced in breast cancer cells compared to nonmalignant breast epithelial cells; ferroportin protein abundance correlates with metabolically available iron. Ferroportin protein is also present in normal human mammary tissue and markedly decreased in breast cancer tissue, with the highest degree of anaplasia associated with lowest ferroportin expression. Transfection of breast cancer cells with ferroportin significantly reduces their growth after orthotopic implantation in the mouse mammary fat pad. Gene expression profiles in breast cancers from {$>$}800 women reveal that decreased ferroportin gene expression is associated with a significant reduction in metastasis-free and disease-specific survival that is independent of other breast cancer risk factors. High ferroportin and low hepcidin gene expression identifies an extremely favorable cohort of breast cancer patients who have a 10-year survival of {$>$}90\%. Ferroportin is a pivotal protein in breast biology and a strong and independent predictor of prognosis in breast cancer.},

  abstract = {The relationship between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC) has been the subject of scientific debate. To estimate the summary association between red meat intake and CRC and to examine sources of heterogeneity, a meta-analysis of prospective studies was conducted. Thirty-four prospective studies of red meat and CRC were identified, of which 25 represented independent nonoverlapping study populations. Summary relative risk estimates (SRREs) for high versus low intake and dose-response relationships were calculated. In the high versus low intake meta-analysis, the SRRE was 1.12 (95\% CI: 1.04-1.21) with significant heterogeneity (P = 0.014). Summary associations were modified by tumor site and sex. The SRREs for colon cancer and rectal cancer were 1.11 (95\% CI: 1.03-1.19) and 1.19 (95\% CI: 0.97-1.46), respectively. The SRREs among men and women were 1.21 (95\% CI: 1.04-1.42) and 1.01 (95\% CI: 0.87-1.17), respectively. The available epidemiologic data are not sufficient to support an independent and unequivocal positive association between red meat intake and CRC. This conclusion is based on summary associations that are weak in magnitude, heterogeneity across studies, inconsistent patterns of associations across the subgroup analyses, and the likely influence of confounding by other dietary and lifestyle factors.

Our understanding of and ability to control cell death is impeded by an incomplete characterization of the full range of cell death processes that occur in mammalian systems, especially in response to exogenous perturbations. We present here a general approach to address this problem, which we call modulatory profiling. Modulatory profiles are composed of the changes in potency and efficacy of lethal compounds produced by a second cell death-modulating agent in human cell lines. We show that compounds with the same characterized mechanism of action have similar modulatory profiles. Furthermore, clustering of modulatory profiles revealed relationships not evident when clustering lethal compounds based on gene expression profiles alone. Finally, modulatory profiling of compounds correctly predicted three previously uncharacterized compounds to be microtubule-destabilizing agents, classified numerous compounds that act nonspecifically, and identified compounds that cause cell death through a mechanism that is morphologically and biochemically distinct from previously established ones.},

  abstract = {Changes in iron regulation characterize the malignant state. However, the pathways that effect these changes and their specific impact on prognosis remain poorly understood. We capitalized on publicly available microarray datasets comprising 674 breast cancer cases to systematically investigate how expression of genes related to iron metabolism is linked to breast cancer prognosis. Of 61 genes involved in iron regulation, 49\% were statistically significantly associated with distant metastasis-free survival. Cases were divided into test and training cohorts, and the supervised principal component method was used to stratify cases into risk groups. Optimal risk stratification was achieved with a model comprising 16 genes, which we term the iron regulatory gene signature (IRGS). Multivariable analysis revealed that the IRGS contributes information not captured by conventional prognostic indicators (HR = 1.61; 95\% confidence interval: 1.16-2.24; P = 0.004). The IRGS successfully stratified homogeneously treated patients, including ER+ patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy, both with (P = 0.006) and without (P = 0.03) lymph node metastases. To test whether multiple pathways were embedded within the IRGS, we evaluated the performance of two gene dyads with known roles in iron biology in ER+ patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy (n = 371). For both dyads, gene combinations that minimized intracellular iron content [anti-import: TFRCLow/HFEHigh; or pro-export: SLC40A1 (ferroportin) (High)/HAMP(Low)] were associated with favorable prognosis (P {$<$} 0.005). Although the clinical utility of the IRGS will require further evaluation, its ability to both identify high-risk patients within traditionally low-risk groups and low-risk patients within high-risk groups has the potential to affect therapeutic decision making.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether red and processed meat consumption is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to summarise the evidence from prospective studies of red and processed meat consumption and pancreatic cancer risk. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and EMBASE databases through November 2011. Study-specific results were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Eleven prospective studies, with 6643 pancreatic cancer cases, were included in the meta-analysis. An increase in red meat consumption of 120 g per day was associated with an overall relative risk (RR) of 1.13 (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93-1.39; P-heterogeneity {$<$}0.001). Red meat consumption was positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk in men (RR = 1.29; 95\% CI = 1.08-1.53; P-heterogeneity = 0.28; five studies), but not in women (RR = 0.93; 95\% CI = 0.74-1.16; P-heterogeneity = 0.21; six studies). The RR of pancreatic cancer for a 50 g per day increase in processed meat consumption was 1.19 (95\% CI 1.04-1.36; P-heterogeneity = 0.46). CONCLUSION: Findings from this meta-analysis indicate that processed meat consumption is positively associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Red meat consumption was associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in men. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

  abstract = {Objective: Estimation of the role of main dietary compounds in the risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Research methods and procedures: Literature published till 2010 was reviewed and selected for further analysis. The used terms were: red meat, minced meat, ham, bacon, sausages, white meat, poultry, vegetables, fish, eggs, fruits, lifestyle, diet, pancreatic cancer and pancreatic neoplasm. The collected data were meta-analysed with calculation of combined relative risk and 95\% confidence interval as well as studies heterogeneity. Results: A meta-analysis of 11 case-control studies indicates that red meat ingestion elevates pancreatic cancer risk by 48\% (95\% CI = 1.25-1.76). The vegetables and fruit reduce the risk by 38\% (95\% CI = 0.54-0.73) and 29\% (95\% CI = 0.59-0.84), respectively. The pooled analyses of 10 cohort studies do not show significant relations between main dietary compound ingestion and pancreatic cancer risk. Conclusion: The red meat intake is associated with elevated risk of pancreatic cancer in contrast to vegetables and fruit ingestion. The ingestion of red meat, vegetables and fruit in cohort studies was not influenced on pancreatic cancer risk. The role of fish, poultry and eggs was not significant in both case-control and cohort studies, thus further studies were needed. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Even though recent studies suggest that a high intake of heme iron is associated with several types of cancer, epidemiological studies in relation to gastric cancer (GC) are lacking. Our previous results show a positive association between red and processed meat and non cardia gastric cancer, especially in Helicobacter pylori infected subjects. The aim of the study is to investigate the association between heme iron intake and GC risk in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition (EURGAST-EPIC). Dietary intake was assessed by validated center-specific questionnaires. Heme iron was calculated as a type-specific percentage of the total iron content in meat intake, derived from the literature. Antibodies of H. pylori infection and vitamin C levels were measured in a sub-sample of cases and matched controls included in a nested case-control study within the cohort. The study included 481,419 individuals and 444 incident cases of GC that occurred during an average of 8.7 years of followup. We observed a statistically significant association between heme iron intake and GC risk (HR 1.13 95\% CI: 1.011.26 for a doubling of intake) adjusted by sex, age, BMI, education level, tobacco smoking and energy intake. The positive association between heme iron and the risk of GC was statistically significant in subjects with plasma vitamin C {$<$}39 mmol/l only (log2 HR 1.54 95\% CI (1.012.35). We found a positive association between heme iron intake and gastric cancer risk.},

  abstract = {This was a 24-week, multicenter phase-2 study designed to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of FBS0701, a novel oral chelator, in adults with transfusional iron overload. Fifty-one patients, stratified by transfusional iron intake, were randomized to FBS0701 at either 14.5 or 29 mg/kg/d (16 and 32 mg/kg/d salt form). FBS0701 was generally well tolerated at both doses. Forty-nine patients (96\%) completed the study. There were no drug-related serious adverse events. No adverse events (AEs) showed dose-dependency in frequency or severity. Treatment-related nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea were each noted in {$<$}5\% of patients. Mean serum creatinine did not change significantly from Baseline or between dose groups. Transaminases wer increased in 8 (16\%), three of whom acquired HCV on-study from a single blood bank while five had an abnormal baseline ALT. The 24 week mean change in liver iron concentration (Delta LIC) at 14.5 mg/kg/d was +3.1 mg/g (dw); 29\% achieved a decrease in LIC. Mean Delta LIC at 29 mg/kg/d was -0.3 mg/g (dw); 44\% achieved a decrease in LIC (P {$<$} .03 for Delta LIC between doses). The safety and tolerability profile at therapeutic doses compare favorably to other oral chelators. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01186419.

  abstract = {Iron overload due to increased intestinal iron absorption represents an important clinical problem in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT), particularly as they advance in age. Current models for iron metabolism in patients with beta (beta)-thalassemia intermedia (TI) suggest that suppression of serum hepcidin results in increased iron absorption and release of iron from the reticuloendothelial system, leading to depletion of macrophage iron, relatively low levels of serum ferritin, and liver iron loading. The clinical consequences of iron overload in patients with NTDT are multifactorial and include endocrinopathy, bone disease, thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension, cerebrovascular and neuronal damage, liver fibrosis or cirrhosis, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Although serum ferritin levels correlate with liver iron concentration (LIC), they underestimate iron load in these patients compared with transfusion-dependent patients with equivalent LIC. Therefore, direct measurement of LIC is recommended with chelation therapy as indicated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Pre-clinical studies have shown that iron can be carcinogenic, but few population-based studies investigated the association between markers of the iron metabolism and risk of cancer while taking into account inflammation. We assessed the link between serum iron (SI), total-iron binding capacity (TIBC), and risk of cancer by levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in a large population-based study (n = 220,642). From the Swedish Apolipoprotein Mortality Risk (AMORIS) study, we selected all participants ({$>$} 20 years old) with baseline measurements of serum SI, TIBC, and CRP. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was carried out for standardized and quartile values of SI and TIBC. Similar analyses were performed for specific cancers (pancreatic, colon, liver, respiratory, kidney, prostate, stomach, and breast cancer). To avoid reverse causation, we excluded those with follow-up {$<$} 3 years. We found a positive association between standardized TIBC and overall cancer [HR 1.03 (95 \% CI 1.01-1.05)]. No statistically significant association was found between SI and cancer risk except for postmenopausal breast cancer [HR for standardized SI 1.09 (95 \% CI 1.02-1.15)]. The association between TIBC and specific cancer was only statistically significant for colon cancer [i.e., HR for standardized TIBC: 1.17 (95 \% CI 1.08-1.28)]. A borderline interaction between SI and levels of CRP was observed only in stomach cancer. As opposed to pre-clinical findings for serum iron and cancer, this population-based epidemiological study showed an inverse relation between iron metabolism and cancer risk. Minimal role of inflammatory markers observed warrants further study focusing on developments of specific cancers.},

Indeed, three sample mononuclear enzymes, peptide deformylase, threonine dehydrogenase, and cytosine deaminase, were rapidly damaged by micromolar hydrogen peroxide in vitro and in live Escherichia coli. The first two enzymes use a cysteine residue to coordinate the catalytic metal atom; it was quantitatively oxidized by the radical generated by the Fenton reaction. Because oxidized cysteine can be repaired by cellular reductants, the effect was to avoid irreversible damage to other active-site residues. Nevertheless, protracted H2O2 exposure gradually inactivated these enzymes, consistent with the overoxidation of the cysteine residue to sulfinic or sulfonic forms. During H2O2 stress, E. coli defended all three proteins by inducing MntH, a manganese importer, and Dps, an iron-sequestration protein. These proteins appeared to collaborate in replacing the iron atom with nonoxidizable manganese. The implication is that mononuclear metalloproteins are common targets of H2O2 and that both structural and metabolic arrangements exist to protect them.},

  abstract = {Background: Although iron is essential for all cells, it could be potentially hazardous. This is mostly due to iron participation in oxidation-reduction reactions. In terms of cancer risk, the role of both iron deficiency and overload can be studied in two directions, protective or therapeutic effects, and carcinogenic effects. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Science direct, Ovid, Proquest, Medline, and Google scholar databases were used to obtain articles identified by using the key words "Iron", "Iron deficiency", "Iron overload", "Cancer", and "Neoplasm" without any time limit. The relevance of studies was identified by reviewing the titles and the abstracts. 185 articles published in English, including experimental, observational, molecular and cellular studies were reviewed. Results and Conclusion: Considering the dual nature of iron, maintaining an optimal iron level in the body is important. This can be achieved when regulatory mechanisms of body iron level work properly and the amount of iron input is within the physiological range. Current evidence generally supports this possibility that higher animal-derived (heme) iron may increase the risk of some cancers. The release of iron or nitrosylheme from iron complexes during some processing of meat may increase production of cancer promoter lipoperoxides. On the other hand, use of iron chelation or iron mediated oxidative assault for the treatment or prevention of cancer appears to be promising; but further research is required. Considering this background, this article reviews the literature and evidence, focusing on the role of iron overload and deficiency in developing and treatment of various cancers.},

  abstract = {Nonapoptotic forms of cell death may facilitate the selective elimination of some tumor cells or be activated in specific pathological states. The oncogenic RAS-selective lethal small molecule erastin triggers a unique iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death that we term ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is dependent upon intracellular iron, but not other metals, and is morphologically, biochemically, and genetically distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. We identify the small molecule ferrostatin-1 as a potent inhibitor of ferroptosis in cancer cells and glutamate-induced cell death in organotypic rat brain slices, suggesting similarities between these two processes. Indeed, erastin, like glutamate, inhibits cystine uptake by the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system x(c)(-)), creating a void in the antioxidant defenses of the cell and ultimately leading to iron-dependent, oxidative death. Thus, activation of ferroptosis results in the nonapoptotic destruction of certain cancer cells, whereas inhibition of this process may protect organisms from neurodegeneration.},

Furthermore we conducted metaanalysis for colorectal [relative risk (RR), 1.08; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.17], colon (RR = 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.22), breast (RR = 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.09), and lung cancer (RR = 1.12; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.29), for an increase of 1 mg/ day of heme iron intake. Globally, on the basis of the systematic review and the metaanalysis results, a higher intake of heme iron has shown a tendency toward a positive association with cancer risk. Evidence regarding high levels of biomarkers of iron stores (mostly with serum ferritin) suggests a negative effect toward cancer risk. More prospective studies combining research on dietary iron intake, iron biomarkers, genetic susceptibility, and other relevant factors need to be conducted to clarify these findings and better understand the role of iron in cancer development.

  abstract = {The human 6-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate (STEAP) family comprises STEAP1, STEAP2, STEAP3, and STEAP4. All of these proteins are unique to mammals and share an innate activity as metalloreductases, indicating their importance in metal metabolism. Overall, they participate in a wide range of biologic processes, such as molecular trafficking in the endocytic and exocytic pathways and control of cell proliferation and apoptosis. STEAP1 and STEAP2 are overexpressed in several types of human cancers, namely prostate, bladder, colon, pancreas, ovary, testis, breast, cervix, and Ewing sarcoma, but their clinical significance and role in cancer cells are not clear. Still, their localization in the cell membrane and differential expression in normal and cancer tissues make STEAP proteins potential candidates as biomarkers of several cancers, as well as potential targets for new immunotherapeutic strategies for disease attenuation or treatment. This review brings together the current knowledge about each STEAP protein, giving an overview of the roles of this family of proteins in human physiology and disease, and analyzes their potential as immunotherapeutic agents in cancer research.

  abstract = {Context.-A large number of epidemiologic studies have reported on associations between various "inflammatory" factors and coronary heart disease (CHD). Objective.-To assess the associations of blood levels of fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and albumin and leukocyte count with the subsequent risk of CHD. Data Sources.-Meta-analyses of any long-term prospective studies of CHD published before 1998 on any of these 4 factors. Studies were identified by MEDLINE searches, scanning of relevant reference lists, hand searching of cardiology, epidemiology, and other relevant journals, and discussions with authors of relevant reports. Study Selection.-All relevant studies identified were included. Data Extraction.-The following information was abstracted from published reports (supplemented, in several cases, by the authors): size and type of cohort, mean age, mean duration of follow-up, assay methods, degree of adjustment for confounders, and relationship of CHD risk to the baseline assay results. Data Synthesis.-For fibrinogen, with 4018 CHD cases in 18 studies, comparison of individuals in the top third with those in the bottom third of the baseline measurements yielded a combined risk ratio of 1.8 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.0) associated with a difference in long-term usual mean fibrinogen levels of 2.9 mu mol/L (0.1 g/dL) between the top and bottom thirds (10.3 vs 7.4 mu mol/L [0.35 vs 0.25 g/dL]). For CRP, with 1053 CHD cases in 7 studies, the combined risk ratio of 1.7 (95\% CI, 1.4-2.1) was associated with a difference of 1.4 mg/L (2.4 vs 1.0 mg/L). For albumin, with 3770 CHD cases in 8 studies, the combined risk ratio of 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.3-1.7) was associated with a difference of 4 g/L (38 vs 42 g/L, ie, an inverse association). For leukocyte count, with 5337 CHD cases in the 7 largest studies, the combined risk ratio of 1.4 (95\% CI, 1.3-1.5) was associated with a difference of 2.8x10(9)/L (8.4 vs 5.6x10(9)/L). Each of these overall results was highly significant (P{$<$}.0001). Conclusions.-The published results from these prospective studies are remarkably consistent for each factor, indicating moderate but highly statistically significant associations with CHD. Hence, even though mechanisms that might ac count for these associations are not clear, further study of the relevance of these factors to the causation of CHD is warranted.},

  abstract = {Purpose This 3-year, prospective, multicenter trial assessed the safety and efficacy of deferasirox in low-or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients and Methods Eligible patients had serum ferritin {$>$}= 1,000 mu g/L and had received {$>$}= 20 units of RBCs with ongoing transfusion requirements. The starting dose of deferasirox was 20 mg/kg/d, with dose escalation up to 40 mg/kg/d permitted. Results A total of 176 patients were enrolled, and 173 patients received therapy. Median serum ferritin decreased 23\% in the 53\% of patients who completed 12 months of treatment (n = 91), 36.7\% in patients who completed 2 years (n = 49), and 36.5\% in patients who completed 3 years (n = 33) despite continued transfusion requirement. Reduction in serum ferritin significantly correlated with ALT improvement (P {$<$} .001). Labile plasma iron (LPI) was measured quarterly during the first year of the study. Sixty-eight patients (39.3\%) had elevated LPI at baseline. By week 13, LPI levels normalized in all patients with abnormal baseline level. Fifty-one (28\%) of 173 patients experienced hematologic improvement by International Working Group 2006 criteria; of these, only seven patients received growth factors or MDS therapy. Over the 3-year study, 138 (79.8\%) of 173 patients discontinued therapy, 43 patients (24.8\%) because of adverse events or disease progression and 23 patients (13.2\%) because of abnormal laboratory values. The most common drug-related adverse events were gastrointestinal disturbances and increased serum creatinine. There were 28 deaths, none of which were considered related to deferasirox. Conclusion Deferasirox reduces serum ferritin and LPI in transfusion-dependent patients with MDS. A subset of patients had an improvement in hematologic and hepatic parameters.},

  abstract = {Experimental results suggested that iron-induced lipid peroxidation may explain the direct associations observed between red/processed meat intakes and colorectal and breast cancer risk. However, epidemiological evidence is lacking. Thus, we investigated the association between dietary iron intake and breast cancer risk, and its potential modulation by an antioxidant supplementation and lipid intake. This prospective study included 4646 women from the SU. VI. MAX trial (daily lowdose antioxidants vs. placebo). 188 incident breast cancers were diagnosed (median follow-up= 12.6y). Dietary iron intake was assessed using repeated 24h dietary records. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were computed. Dietary iron intake was associated with an increased breast cancer risk (HRT3vs. T1= 1.67 (1.022.71), P-trend= 0.04). This association was observed in the placebo group (HRT3vs. (T1)= 2.80 (1.42-5.54), P-trend= 0.003), but not in the antioxidant-supplemented group (P-trend= 0.7, P-interaction= 0.1). Besides, in the placebo group, the increased breast cancer risk associated with dietary iron intake was more specifically observed in women with higher lipid intake (P-trend= 0.046). These findings suggest that dietary iron intake may be associated with an increased breast cancer risk, especially in women who did not received antioxidants during the trial and who consumed more lipids. This supports the experimental results suggesting that breast cancer risk may be increased by iron-induced lipid peroxidation.},

  abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step for cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) regulates the EMT and the metastasis suppressor gene, N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG1), could play a role in regulating the TGF-beta pathway. NDRG1 expression is markedly increased after chelator-mediated iron depletion via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha-dependent and independent pathways (Le, N. T. and Richardson, D. R. (2004) Blood 104, 2967-2975). Moreover, novel iron chelators show marked and selective anti-tumor activity and are a potential new class of anti-metabolites. Considering this, the current study investigated the relationship between NDRG1 and the EMT to examine if iron chelators can inhibit the EMT via NDRG1 up-regulation. We demonstrated that TGF-beta induces the EMT in HT29 and DU145 cells. Further, the chelators, desferrioxamine (DFO) and di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), inhibited the TGF-beta-induced EMT by maintaining E-cadherin and beta-catenin, at the cell membrane. We then established stable clones with NDRG1 overexpression and knock-down in HT29 and DU145 cells. These data showed that NDRG1 overexpression maintained membrane E-cadherin and beta-catenin and inhibited TGF-beta-stimulated cell migration and invasion. Conversely, NDRG1 knock-down caused morphological changes from an epithelial- to fibroblastic-like phenotype and also increased migration and invasion, demonstrating NDRG1 knockdown induced the EMT and enhanced TGF-beta effects. We also investigated the mechanisms involved and showed the TGF-beta/SMAD and Wnt pathways were implicated in NDRG1 regulation of E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression and translocation. This study demonstrates that chelators inhibit the TGF-beta-induced EMT via a process consistent with NDRG1 up-regulation and elucidates the mechanism of their activity.},

How food and nutrient intakes affect iron status in persons who may be at risk of iron overload because their genetic status is unknown. Objective: The objective was to determine the relation between food and nutrient intakes, HFE genotype, and iron status. Foods and nutrients associated with iron stores, with adjustment for gene mutations associated with hemochromatosis, were explored. Design: A prospective cohort of women aged 35-69 y (the UK Women's Cohort Study) provided information on diet through a questionnaire and food diary; 6779 women in the cohort provided cheek cell samples, blood samples, or both, which were genotyped for C282Y and H63D mutations, and 2489 women also had their iron status assessed. Relations between serum ferritin and iron intake were investigated by using multiple linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: The strongest dietary association with serum ferritin concentration was a positive association with heme iron and not with nonheme or total iron. Weaker positive associations were seen with red and white meat, and negative associations were seen with total energy and white and brown whole-meal bread, independent of genotype and other potential confounders. The effect of genotype on ferritin concentrations primarily occurred after menopause, at which time a strong interaction between genotype and heme iron intake was observed. Other factors associated with serum ferritin concentrations were age, body mass index, blood donation, menopausal status, and HFE genotype. Conclusions: Postmenopausal women eating a diet rich in heme iron and who were C282Y homozygotes had the highest serum ferritin concentrations.},

For example, increased cell proliferation was observed in ER+/PR+ human breast cancer MCF-7, its matching non-cancerous human breast epithelial MCF-12A, and ER+/PR+ murine mammary cancer MXT+ cells, but not in ER-/PR- MDA(-)MB-231, its matching non-cancerous MCF-10A, and MXT- (ER-/ PR+) cells. By mimicking post-menopausal conditions of high estrogen in local breast tissue and increased iron levels due to cessation of menstrual periods, E2 and iron were shown to exert synergistic effects on proliferation of MCF-7 cells and significantly increased Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Western blotting of E2-treated ER+ but not ER- cells showed that E2 also increased transferrin receptor (TfR).

  abstract = {Iron overload has been associated with carcinogenesis in humans. Intraperitoneal administration of ferric nitrilotriacetate initiates a Fenton reaction in renal proximal tubules of rodents that ultimately leads to a high incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after repeated treatments. We performed high-resolution microarray comparative genomic hybridization to identify characteristics in the genomic profiles of this oxidative stress-induced rat RCCs. The results revealed extensive large-scale genomic alterations with a preference for deletions. Deletions and amplifications were numerous and sometimes fragmented, demonstrating that a Fenton reaction is a cause of such genomic alterations in vivo. Frequency plotting indicated that two of the most commonly altered loci corresponded to a Cdkn2a/2b deletion and a Met amplification. Tumor sizes were proportionally associated with Met expression and/or amplification, and clustering analysis confirmed our results. Furthermore, we developed a procedure to compare whole genomic patterns of the copy number alterations among different species based on chromosomal syntenic relationship. Patterns of the rat RCCs showed the strongest similarity to the human RCCs among five types of human cancers, followed by human malignant mesothelioma, an iron overload-associated cancer. Therefore, an iron-dependent Fenton chemical reaction causes large-scale genomic alterations during carcinogenesis, which may result in distinct genomic profiles. Based on the characteristics of extensive genome alterations in human cancer, our results suggest that this chemical reaction may play a major role during human carcinogenesis.},

In this study, we show that after Apc deletion, the cellular iron acquisition proteins TfR1 and DMT1 are rapidly induced. Conversely, restoration of APC reduces cellular iron due to repression of these proteins. To test the functional importance of these findings, we performed in vivo investigations of the impact of iron levels on intestinal tumorigenesis. Strikingly, depletion of luminal (but not systemic) iron strongly suppressed murine intestinal tumorigenesis, whereas increased luminal iron strongly promoted tumorigenesis. Taken together, our data definitively delineate iron as a potent modifier of intestinal tumorigenesis and have important implications for dietary iron supplementation in patients at high risk of colorectal cancer.},

Particular problems with the DL estimator are discussed, and several alternative methods for summarizing heterogeneous evidence are presented. The authors support replacing universal use of the DL estimator with analyses based on a critical synthesis that recognizes the uncertainty in the evidence, focuses on describing and explaining the probable sources of variation in the evidence, and uses random-effects estimates that provide more accurate confidence limits than the DL estimator.},

  abstract = {A number of epidemiological studies have reported inconsistent findings on the association between meat consumption and lung cancer. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between meat consumption and lung cancer risk in epidemiological studies. Twenty-three case-control and 11 cohort studies were included. All studies adjusted for smoking or conducted in never smokers. The summary relative risks (RRs) of lung cancer for the highest versus lowest intake categories were 1.35 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.69) for total meat, 1.34 (95\% CI 1.18-1.52) for red meat, and 1.06 (95\% CI 0.90-1.25) for processed meat. An inverse association was found between poultry intake and lung cancer (RR = 0.91, 95\% CI 0.85-0.97), but not for total white meat (RR = 1.06, 95\% CI 0.82-1.37) or fish (RR = 1.01, 95\% CI 0.96-1.07). The relationship between meat intake and lung cancer risk appears to depend on the types of meat consumed. A high intake of red meat may increase the risk of lung cancer by about 35\%, while a high intake of poultry decreases the risk by about 10\%. More well-designed cohort studies on meat mutagens or heme iron, meat cooking preferences, and doneness level are needed to fully characterize this meat-lung cancer association.},

  abstract = {The use of iron supplements is an accepted treatment for nonhereditary anemia. The use of iron supplements as prophylaxis is more controversial. We estimated the proportion of persons who consumed supplements that contain iron among the following groups: nonpregnant, nonlactating adolescents, aged 14-18 y (n = 992); women aged 19-50 y (n = 5,062); women aged 51 y and older (n = 3,593); pregnant women (n = 295); and lactating women (n = 97) using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994. We found that the proportion (\% +/- SE) Of U.S. women consuming supplements containing iron in the previous month was 9 +/- 2\% among nonpregnant, nonlactating adolescents; 23 +/- 1 \% among women aged 19 y and older; 72 +/- 4\% among pregnant women; and 60 +/- 8\% among lactating women. Low income women were less likely to consume supplements containing iron. Minority women were less likely to consume supplements containing iron in all groups except adolescents. Among consumers of supplements that contain iron, the median intake of iron was 11 mg/d among nonpregnant adolescents, similar to17 mg/d among nonpregnant women, 58 mg/d among pregnant women and 57 mg/d among lactating women. Use of supplements that contain iron was associated with a significantly reduced prevalence of iron deficiency among women 19-50 y but not among other groups. Groups at highest risk of iron deficiency (e.g., low income and minority women) are often least likely to consume supplements containing iron, suggesting that supplement use is unrelated to actual need.},

  abstract = {Deferasirox is an orally effective iron (Fe) chelator currently used for the treatment of iron-overload disease and has been implemented as an alternative to the gold standard chelator, desferrioxamine (DFO). Earlier studies demonstrated that DFO exhibits anticancer activity due to its ability to deplete cancer cells of iron. In this investigation, we examined the in vitro and in vivo activity of deferasirox against cells from human solid tumors. To date, there have been no studies to investigate the effect of deferasirox on these types of tumors in vivo. Deferasirox demonstrated similar activity at inhibiting proliferation of DMS-53 lung carcinoma and SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell lines compared with DFO. Furthermore, deferasirox was generally similar or slightly more effective than DFO at mobilizing cellular Fe-59 and inhibiting iron uptake from human transferrin depending on the cell type. However, deferasirox potently inhibited DMS-53 xenograft growth in nude mice when given by oral gavage, with no marked alterations in normal tissue histology. To understand the antitumor activity of deferasirox, we investigated its effect on the expression of molecules that play key roles in metastasis, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. We demonstrated that deferasirox increased expression of the metastasis suppressor protein N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 and upregulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) while decreasing cyclin D1 levels. Moreover, this agent increased the expression of apoptosis markers, including cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1. Collectively, we demonstrate that deferasirox is an orally effective antitumor agent against solid tumors.},

  abstract = {The relative importance of biochemical pathways has not been previously examined when considering the influence of diet on breast cancer risk. To address this issue, we used interview data from a population-based sample of 1463 breast cancer cases and 1500 controls. Dietary intake was assessed shortly after diagnosis using a 101-item food frequency questionnaire. Age- and energy-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for individual micro- and macronutrients were estimated with logistic regression. Hierarchical modeling was used to account for biologically plausible nutrient pathways (1-carbon metabolism, oxidative stress, glycemic control, and phytoestrogens). Effect estimates from hierarchical modeling were more precise and plausible compared to those from multivariable models. The strongest relationship observed was for the glycemic control pathway, but confidence intervals (CI) were wide [OR (95\% CI): 0.86 (0.62, 1.21)]. Little or no effect was observed for the 1-carbon metabolism, oxidative stress, and phytoestrogen pathways. Associations were similar when stratified by supplement use. Our approach that emphasizes biochemical pathways, rather than individual nutrients, revealed that breast cancer risk may be more strongly associated with glycemic control factors than those from other pathways considered. Our study emphasizes the importance of accounting for multiple nutrient pathways when examining associations between dietary intake and breast cancer.},

  abstract = {The iron-regulated metastasis suppressor, N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), is up-regulated by cellular iron depletion mediated by iron chelators and can inhibit cancer cell migration. However, the mechanism of how NDRG1 achieves this effect remains unclear. In this study, we implemented established and newly constructed NDRG1 overexpression and knockdown models using the DU145, HT29, and HCT116 cancer cell lines to investigate the molecular basis by which NDRG1 exerts its inhibitory effect on cell migration. Using these models, we demonstrated that NDRG1 overexpression inhibits cell migration by preventing actin-filament polymerization, stress fiber assembly and formation. In contrast, NDRG1 knockdown had the opposite effect. Moreover, we identified that NDRG1 inhibited an important regulatory pathway mediated by the Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1)/phosphorylated myosin light chain 2 (pMLC2) pathway that modulates stress fiber assembly. The phosphorylation of MLC2 is a key process in inducing stress fiber contraction, and this was shown to be markedly decreased or increased by NDRG1 overexpression or knockdown, respectively. The mechanism involved in the inhibition of MLC2 phosphorylation by NDRG1 was mediated by a significant (P {$<$} 0.001) decrease in ROCK1 expression that is a key kinase involved in MLC2 phosphorylation. Considering that NDRG1 is up-regulated after cellular iron depletion, novel thiosemicarbazone iron chelators (e.g., di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone) were demonstrated to inhibit ROCK1/pMLC2-modulated actin-filament polymerization, stress fiber assembly, and formation via a mechanism involving NDRG1. These results highlight the role of the ROCK1/pMLC2 pathway in the NDRG1-mediated antimetastatic signaling network and the therapeutic potential of iron chelators at inhibiting metastasis.},

  abstract = {Background: The evidence for red meat as a determinant of colorectal cancer remains equivocal, which might be explained by differences in heme content. Heme is the prooxidant, iron-containing porphyrin pigment of meat and its content depends on the type of meat. Chlorophyll from green vegetables might modify this association. Methods: The Netherlands Cohort Study was initiated in 1986 when a self-administered questionnaire on risk factors for cancer was completed by 120,852 subjects ages 55 to 69 years. After 9.3 years of follow-up through the Cancer Registry, 1,535 incident colorectal cancer cases (869 men and 666 women) were available. Nineteen of the 150 items in the validated dietary questionnaire related to consumption of specific types of fresh and processed meat. Heme iron content was calculated as a type-specific percentage of the total iron content and chlorophyll content of vegetables was derived from the literature. Results: Multivariate rate ratios for quintiles of heme iron intake and colon cancer were 1.00, 0.98, 1.04, 1.13, and 1.29 (P-trend = 0.10) among men and 1.00, 1.31, 1.44, 1.18, and 1.20 (P-trend = 0.56) among women, respectively. No consistent associations were observed for rectal cancer. Rate ratios for colon cancer increased across successive quintiles of the ratio of heme/chlorophyll among men only (1.00, 1.08, 1.01, 1.32, and 1.43; P-trend = 0.01). No associations were observed between fresh meat and colorectal cancer. Conclusion: Our data suggest an elevated risk of colon cancer in men with increasing intake of heme iron and decreasing intake of chlorophyll. Further research is needed to confirm these results.},

Here, we report the neuroprotective effects of curcumin which attenuates necroptosis. Primary cortical neurons were cultured and were injured by ferrous chloride, z.vad.fmk was applied to block apoptosis, curcumin was administrated to protect neurons, necrostatin-1 was applied to inhibit necroptosis if needed. Cell viability was measured by detecting lactate dehydrogenase activity in lysates of surviving cells, and assessed by cell counting kit-8. The expression of receptor interacting protein 1 was detected by immunoblot and immunofluorescence. Results showed that necroptosis mainly occurred in the concentrations of ferrous chloride ranging from 100 to 200 mu M, curcumin attenuated necroptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, curcumin decreased expression of receptor interacting protein 1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that curcumin protects against iron induced neurotoxicity in primary cortical neurons by attenuating necroptosis.

  abstract = {Certain food groups are often rejected during chemotherapy (CT) due to the side effects of treatment, which may interfere with adequate diet and nutritional status. The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment impact on the diet and nutritional status of women with breast cancer (BC). In this prospective longitudinal study, conducted in 2014-2015, 55 women diagnosed with BC, with a mean age 51.5 +/- 10.1 years, were followed and data were collected at three different times. Anthropometric and dietary assessments were performed, the latter by applying nine 24h dietary recalls, by using the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index Revised (BHEI-R), and calculating the prevalence of inadequacy by the EAR cut-off point method. Regarding the BHEI-R analysis, the majority of women had a "diet requires modification', both at the beginning (T0, 58.2\%, n = 32) and during treatment (T1, 54.5\%, n = 30). However, after the end of the CT, the greater percentage of patients (T2, 49.1\%, n = 27) were classified as having an "inadequate diet", since the Total Fruit consumption as well as the Dark Green and Orange Vegetable and Legume consumption decreased significantly during treatment (p = 0.043 and p = 0.026, respectively). There was a significant reduction in the intake of macro and micronutrients, with a high prevalence of inadequacy, of up to 100\%, for calcium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, niacin, riboflavin, thiamin, vitamin B6, vitamin C and zinc. Assessment of the nutritional status indicated that 56\% (n = 31) of patients were overweight at these three different times. Weight, BMI and Waist Circumference increased significantly, indicating a worse nutritional status, and there was a correlation between poor diet quality and higher values for BMI, Waist-Hip Ratio and Waist-to-Height Ratio. Chemotherapy interferes in the patients' diet generating a negative impact on the quality and intake of micro and macronutrients, as well as an impact on their nutritional status, with an increase in anthropometric measurements.},

A liposomal nanodelivery complex (scL) for systemic, tumor-targeting delivery of anticancer therapeutics has been developed. scL employs an anti-transferrin receptor (TfR), scFv as the targeting molecule. Loss of p53 suppressor function, through mutations or inactivation of the p53 pathway, is present in most human cancers. Rather than being transiently permissive for tumor initiation, persistence of p53 dysfunction is a continuing requirement for maintaining tumor growth. Herein, we report results of a first-in-man Phase I clinical trial of restoration of the normal human tumor suppressor gene p53 using the scL nanocomplex (SGT-53). Minimal side effects were observed in this trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. Furthermore, the majority of patients demonstrated stable disease. One patient with adenoid cystic carcinoma had his status changed from unresectable to resectable after one treatment cycle. More significantly, we observed an accumulation of the transgene in metastatic tumors, but not in normal skin tissue, in a dose-related manner. These results show not only that systemically delivered SGT-53 is well tolerated and exhibits anticancer activity, but also supply evidence of targeted tumor delivery of SGT-53 to metastatic lesions.},

The effect of an element is determined by several characteristics, including absorption, metabolism, and degree of interaction with physiological processes. Iron is an essential element for almost all living organisms as it participates in a wide variety of metabolic processes, including oxygen transport, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, and electron transport. However, as iron can form free radicals, its concentration in body tissues must be tightly regulated because in excessive amounts, it can lead to tissue damage. Disorders of iron metabolism are among the most common diseases of humans and encompass a broad spectrum of diseases with diverse clinical manifestations, ranging from anemia to iron overload, and possibly to neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the latest progress in studies of iron metabolism and bioavailability, and our current understanding of human iron requirement and consequences and causes of iron deficiency. Finally, we discuss strategies for prevention of iron deficiency.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is a member of the lipocalin superfamily, and it has an important role in the regulation of cellular oncogenesis and apoptosis. However, the role for LCN2 in prostate cancer remains unclear. METHOD. LCN2 expression has been determined by Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry in the human prostate cell lines PC3, DU145, LNCaP, and 22Rv, and in human prostate tissue array. In this study, we identified shRNA-LCN2 to determine the role of LCN2 in prostate-cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Cell proliferative ability was measured by MTT, colony-formation, and cell-cycle analysis. The role of LCN2 in prostate-cancer cell migration and invasion was analyzed by cell-migration assay and Matrigel invasion assay. The effect of LCN2 knockdown on prostate tumor growth was assessed in a subcutaneous xenograft model. RESULTS. LCN2 protein and mRNA expression are higher in PC3 and DU145 cells than in LNCaP and 22Rv cells, and prostate cancer tissue correlated significantly with tumor differentiation (P{$<$}0.017) and Gleason's grade (P{$<$}0.02). LCN2 knockdown in PC3 and DU145 cells decreased cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle arrest, migration, and invasion. Conversely, LCN2 overexpression in 22Rv cells produced the opposite effect. Subcutaneous xenografts in mice models showed decreased tumor growth in the LCN2-knockdown mice. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that LCN2 might play an important role in regulation of proliferation and invasion of human prostate cancer, and that it can be a valuable marker of prostate cancer progression.

In a case-control study involving 252 matched pairs nested in a cohort of 9,315 women with benign breast disease, we investigated these associations by directly measuring elemental levels in breast tissue using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Quintile analyses revealed positive associations of breast cancer, of borderline statistical significance, with zinc [highest versus lowest quintile: odds ratio (OR), 1.37; 95\% confidence limit (95\% CL), 0.91, 2.05; P-trend = 0.041, iron (highest versus lowest quintile: OR, 1.58; 95\% CL, 1.02, 2.44; P-trend = 0.07), and calcium (highest versus lowest quintile: OR, 1.46; 95\% CL, 0.98, 2.17; P-trend = 0.14), but little association with selenium (highest versus lowest quintile: OR, 1.10; 95\% CL, 0.72, 1.68; P-trend = 0.76). The associations were weakened by mutual adjustment. Furthermore, after stratification by menopausal status, the positive association between iron and breast cancer was confined to postmenopausal women (highest versus lowest quintile: OR, 2.77; 95\% CL, 1.25, 6.13; P-trend = 0.008), whereas the associations for zinc, calcium, and selenium did not differ by menopausal stratum. In conclusion, our data raise the possibility that relatively high levels of zinc, iron, and calcium in benign breast tissue may be associated with a modest increase in risk of subsequent breast cancer.},

PLCO offers an example of coordinated research by both the extramural and intramural communities of the National Institutes of Health. The purpose of this article is to describe the PLCO research resource and how it is managed and to assess the productivity and the costs associated with this resource. Such an in-depth analysis of a single large-scale project can shed light on questions such as how large-scale projects should be managed, what metrics should be used to assess productivity, and how costs can be compared with productivity metrics. A comprehensive publication analysis identified 335 primary research publications resulting from research using PLCO data and biospecimens from 2000 to 2012. By the end of 2012, a total of 9679 citations (excluding self-citations) have resulted from this body of research publications, with an average of 29.7 citations per article, and an h index of 45, which is comparable with other large-scale studies, such as the Nurses Health Study. In terms of impact on public health, PLCO trial results have been used by the US Preventive Services Task Force in making recommendations concerning prostate and ovarian cancer screening. The overall cost of PLCO was \$454 million over 20 years, adjusted to 2011 dollars, with approximately \$37 million for the collection, processing, and storage of biospecimens, including blood samples, buccal cells, and pathology tissues.},

  abstract = {Experimental and epidemiologic evidence suggests that dysregulation of proteins involved in iron metabolism plays a critical role in cancer. The mechanisms by which cancer cells alter homeostatic iron regulation are just beginning to be understood. Here, we demonstrate that iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) plays a key role in iron accumulation in breast cancer. Although both IRP1 and IRP2 are overexpressed in breast cancer, the overexpression of IRP2, but not IRP1, is associated with decreased ferritin H and increased transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). Knockdown of IRP2 in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells increases ferritin H expression and decreases TfR1 expression, resulting in a decrease in the labile iron pool. Further, IRP2 knockdown reduces growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in the mouse mammary fat pad. Gene expression microarray profiles of patients with breast cancer demonstrate that increased IRP2 expression is associated with high-grade cancer. Increased IRP2 expression is observed in luminal A, luminal B, and basal breast cancer subtypes, but not in breast tumors of the ERBB2 molecular subtype. These results suggest that dysregulation of IRP2 is an early nodal point underlying altered iron metabolism in breast cancer and may contribute to poor outcome of some patients with breast cancer.

A century later, another form of cell death, apoptosis, was defined, and we now understand that this process is driven by a set of molecular mechanisms that programs the cell to die. It has often been assumed that necrosis is distinct from apoptosis, in part because of the belief that necrosis is not programmed by molecular events.

This review summarizes epidemiological and nonclinical data on the role of iron in carcinogenesis. In humans, epidemiological data suggest correlations between certain cancers and increased iron exposure or iron overload. Nonclinical models that investigated whether iron can enhance carcinogenesis provide only limited evidence relevant for cancer patients since they were typically based on high iron doses as well as injection routes and iron formulations which are not used in the clinical setting. Nevertheless, in the absence of long-term outcome data from prospectively defined trials in i.v. iron-treated cancer patients, iron supplementation should be limited to periods of concomitant anti-tumor treatment.

  abstract = {Ascorbate (vitamin C) was an early, unorthodox therapy for cancer, with an outstanding safety profile and anecdotal clinical benefit. Because oral ascorbate was ineffective in two cancer clinical trials, ascorbate was abandoned by conventional oncology but continued to be used in complementary and alternative medicine. Recent studies provide rationale for reexamining ascorbate treatment. Because of marked pharmacokinetic differences, intravenous, but not oral, ascorbate produces millimolar concentrations both in blood and in tissues, killing cancer cells without harming normal tissues. In the interstitial fluid surrounding tumor cells, millimolar concentrations of ascorbate exert local pro-oxidant effects by mediating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formation, which kills cancer cells. We investigated downstream mechanisms of ascorbate-induced cell death. Data show that millimolar ascorbate, acting as a pro-oxidant, induced DNA damage and depleted cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), activated the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, and resulted in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition and death in ovarian cancer cells. The combination of parenteral ascorbate with the conventional chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin and paclitaxel synergistically inhibited ovarian cancer in mouse models and reduced chemotherapy-associated toxicity in patients with ovarian cancer. On the basis of its potential benefit and minimal toxicity, examination of intravenous ascorbate in combination with standard chemotherapy is justified in larger clinical trials.},

Epidemiological and experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that heme iron present in meat promotes colorectal cancer. This meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies of colon cancer reporting heme intake included 566,607 individuals and 4,734 cases of colon cancer. The relative risk of colon cancer was 1.18 (95\% CI: 1.06-1.32) for subjects in the highest category of heme iron intake compared with those in the lowest category. Epidemiological data thus show a suggestive association between dietary heme and risk of colon cancer. The analysis of experimental studies in rats with chemically-induced colon cancer showed that dietary hemoglobin and red meat consistently promote aberrant crypt foci, a putative precancer lesion. The mechanism is not known, but heme iron has a catalytic effect on (i) the endogenous formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds and (ii) the formation of cytotoxic and genotoxic aldehydes by lipoperoxidation. A review of evidence supporting these hypotheses suggests that both pathways are involved in heme iron toxicity. Cancer Prev Res; 4(2); 177-84. (C)2011 AACR.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between meat intake and risk of esophageal cancer. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library (April 2013) for cohort and case-control studies that assessed meat intake and esophageal cancer risk. Random-effect or fixed-effect models were used to pool relative risks (RRs) from individual studies with heterogeneity and publication bias analyses carried out. Seven cohort and 28 case-control studies were included. The summary RRs for esophageal cancer for the highest versus lowest consumption categories were 1.19 (95 \% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.46) for total meat, 1.55 (95 \% CI 1.22-1.96) for red meat, 1.33 (95 \% CI 1.04-1.69) for processed meat, 0.72 (95 \% CI 0.60-0.86) for white meat, 0.83 (95 \% CI 0.72-0.96) for poultry, and 0.95 (95 \% CI 0.76-1.19) for fish. When striated by histological subtype, positive associations were seen among esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and red meat, white meat and poultry, and esophageal adenocarcinoma with total meat and processed meat. Meat consumption is associated with esophageal cancer risk, which depends on meat type and histological type of esophageal cancer. High intake of red meat and low intake of poultry are associated with an increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. High meat intake, especially processed meat, is likely to increase esophageal adenocarcinoma risk. And fish consumption may not be associated with incidence of esophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {Iron is an essential micronutrient for human health and inadequate intake may result in iron deficiency (ID) or iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). Unlike other recent studies investigating iron status in young women, this cross-sectional study analysed dietary intake and biochemical data from healthy young (18-35 years) women (n = 299) to determine the association between both haem iron (HI) and non-haem iron (NHI) intakes and serum ferritin (SF). Dietary restraint and possible inflammation secondary to obesity were also measured and accounted for, and energy intake was adjusted for using the residuals method. Independent samples t-tests and chi-squared tests were performed, and factors found to be significantly different between iron replete (IR) and ID/IDA participants were analysed using general linear modelling. ID/IDA participants consumed significantly lower total energy than iron replete (IR) (p = 0.003). Lower energy intake was also associated with higher levels of dietary restraint (p = 0.001). Both HI and NHI were positively associated with SF with HI was found to be a stronger predictor ( = 0.128, p = 0.009) than NHI ( = 0.037, p = 0.028). The study demonstrates that intake of both HI and NHI, as well as adequate dietary energy, are associated with normal iron status levels in young women, and that restrained eaters may be at greater risk of low iron status.},

  abstract = {Current cancer management strategies fail to adequately treat malignancies with multivariable dose-restricting factors such as systemic toxicity and multi-drug resistance limiting therapeutic benefit, quality of life and complete long-term remission rates. The targeted delivery of a therapeutic compound aims to enhance its circulation and cellular uptake, decrease systemic toxicity and improve therapeutic benefit with disease specificity. The transferrin peptide, its receptor and their biological significance, has been widely characterised and vastly relevant when applied to targeting strategies. Utilising knowledge about the physiological function of the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex and the efficiency of its receptor-mediated endocytosis provides rationale to continue the development of transferrin-targeted anticancer modalities. Furthermore, multiple studies report an upregulation in expression of the transferrin receptor on metastatic and drug resistant tumours, highlighting its selectivity to cancer. Due to the increased expression of the transferrin receptor in brain glioma, the successful delivery of anticancer compounds to the tumour site and the ability to cross the blood brain barrier has shown to be an important discovery. Its significance in the development of cancer-specific therapies is shown to be important by direct conjugation and immunotoxin studies which use transferrin and anti-transferrin receptor antibodies as the targeting moiety. Such conjugates have demonstrated enhanced cellular uptake via transferrin-mediated mechanisms and increased selective cytotoxicity in a number of cancer cell lines and tumour xenograft animal models. In addition, incubation of chemotherapy-insensitive cancer cells with transferrin-targeted conjugates in vitro has resulted in a reversal of their drug resistance. Transferrin immunotoxins have also shown similar promise, with a diphtheria toxin mutant covalently bound to transferrin (Tf-CRM107) currently involved in human clinical trials for the treatment of glioblastoma. Despite this, the inability to translate preliminary research into a clinical setting has compelled research into novel targeting strategies including the use of nanoparticulate theory in the design of drug delivery systems. The main objective of this review is to evaluate the importance of the transferrin-transferrin receptor complex as a target for cancer therapy through extensive knowledge of both the physiological and pathological interactions between the complex and different cell types. In addition, this review serves as a summary to date of direct conjugation and immunotoxin studies, with an emphasis on transferrin as an important targeting moiety in the directed delivery of anticancer therapeutic compounds.},

  abstract = {“Serum ferritin” presents a paradox, as the iron storage protein ferritin is not synthesised in serum yet is to be found there. Serum ferritin is also a well known inflammatory marker, but it is unclear whether serum ferritin reflects or causes inflammation, or whether it is involved in an inflammatory cycle. We argue here that serum ferritin arises from damaged cells, and is thus a marker of cellular damage. The protein in serum ferritin is considered benign, but it has lost (i.e. dumped) most of its normal complement of iron which when unliganded is highly toxic. The facts that serum ferritin levels can correlate with both disease and with body iron stores are thus expected on simple chemical kinetic grounds. Serum ferritin levels also correlate with other phenotypic readouts such as erythrocyte morphology. Overall, this systems approach serves to explain a number of apparent paradoxes of serum ferritin, including (i) why it correlates with biomarkers of cell damage, (ii) why it correlates with biomarkers of hydroxyl radical formation (and oxidative stress) and (iii) therefore why it correlates with the presence and/or severity of numerous diseases. This leads to suggestions for how one might exploit the corollaries of the recognition that serum ferritin levels mainly represent a consequence of cell stress and damage.},

We developed an oral formulation of ciclopirox olamine and conducted the first-in-human phase I study of this drug in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies (Trial registration ID: NCT00990587). Patients were treated with 5-80 mg/m(2) oral ciclopirox olamine once daily for five days in 21-day treatment cycles. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic companion studies were performed in a subset of patients. Following definition of the half-life of ciclopirox olamine, an additional cohort was enrolled and treated with 80 mg/m(2) ciclopirox olamine four times daily. Adverse events and clinical response were monitored throughout the trial. Twenty-three patients received study treatment. Ciclopirox was rapidly absorbed and cleared with a short half-life. Plasma concentrations of an inactive ciclopirox glucuronide metabolite were greater than those of ciclopirox. Repression of survivin expression was observed in peripheral blood cells isolated from patients treated once daily with ciclopirox olamine at doses greater than 10 mg/m(2), demonstrating biological activity of the drug. Dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicities were observed in patients receiving 80 mg/m(2) four times daily, and no dose limiting toxicity was observed at 40 mg/m(2) once daily. Hematologic improvement was observed in two patients. Once-daily dosing of oral ciclopirox olamine was well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies, and further optimization of dosing regimens is warranted in this patient population.

  abstract = {Iron has been suggested as a risk factor for different types of cancers mainly due to its prooxidant activity, which can lead to oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore, subjects with hemochromatosis or iron overload have been shown to have a higher risk of developing liver cancer. We have systematically reviewed 59 epidemiologic studies, published between 1995 and 2012, reporting information on total iron, dietary iron, heme iron, and biomarkers of iron status and cancer risk. Furthermore we conducted metaanalysis for colorectal [relative risk (RR), 1.08; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-1.17], colon (RR = 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.22), breast (RR = 1.03; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.09), and lung cancer (RR = 1.12; 95\% CI, 0.98-1.29), for an increase of 1 mg/ day of heme iron intake. Globally, on the basis of the systematic review and the metaanalysis results, a higher intake of heme iron has shown a tendency toward a positive association with cancer risk. Evidence regarding high levels of biomarkers of iron stores (mostly with serum ferritin) suggests a negative effect toward cancer risk. More prospective studies combining research on dietary iron intake, iron biomarkers, genetic susceptibility, and other relevant factors need to be conducted to clarify these findings and better understand the role of iron in cancer development.

RNA sequencing revealed that inhibition of cystine-glutamate exchange leads to activation of an ER stress response and upregulation of CHAC1, providing a pharmacodynamic marker for system x(c)- inhibition. We also found that the clinically approved anti-cancer drug sorafenib, but not other kinase inhibitors, inhibits system x(c)(-) function and can trigger ER stress and ferroptosis. In an analysis of hospital records and adverse event reports, we found that patients treated with sorafenib exhibited unique metabolic and phenotypic alterations compared to patients treated with other kinase-inhibiting drugs. Finally, using a genetic approach, we identified new genes dramatically upregulated in cells resistant to ferroptosis.},

Triapine is a novel inhibitor of the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. Sequential inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase with triapine and an M1 ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor (fludarabine) was noted to be safe, and led to a 29\% complete plus partial response rate in myeloproliferative neoplasms. This article reports the findings of a phase II trial of triapine (105 mg/m(2)/day) followed by fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/day) daily for 5 consecutive days in 37 patients with accelerated myeloproliferative neoplasms and secondary acute myeloid leukemia. The overall response rate was 49\% (18/37), with a complete remission rate of 24\% (9/37). Overall response rates and complete remissions were seen in all disease subsets, including secondary acute myeloid leukemia, in which the overall response rate and complete remission rate were 48\% and 33\%, respectively. All patients with known JAK2 V617F mutations (6/6) responded. The median overall survival of the entire cohort was 6.9 months, with a median overall survival of both overall responders and complete responders of 10.6 months. These data further demonstrate the promise of sequential inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase in patients with accelerated myeloproliferative neoplasms and secondary acute myeloid leukemia.},

Aerobic cytochrome P450 reductase-mediated redox cycling of 35.50 mu M DESQ, 0.35 mu M EQ, or 3.55 mu M 3,4EQ increased the reduction of succinoylated cytochrome c, a measure of superoxide radical formation, by 19-20\% over control values (24.5 +/- 0.3 mu M) in the absence of estrogen quinone substrate, Rates of Fe2+ release from horse spleen ferritin by cytochrome P450 reductase-mediated redox cycling of 35.50 mu M DESQ, 0.35 mu M EQ, or 3.55 mu M 3,4EQ were 94.4 +/- 0.6, 117.2 +/- 9.4, or 137.7 +/- 19.9 pmol Fe2+/ min, respectively, compared to 67.3 +/- 2.3 pmol Fe2+/ min in the absence of estrogen substrates. Redox cycling of 35.5 mu M DESQ, EQ, or 3,4EQ medial-ed by microsomes of hamster kidney, a target organ of estrogen-induced carcinogenesis, released 511 +/- 30.10, 516.91 +/- 22.90, or 410.27 +/- 28.49 pmol Fe2+/min, respectively. Corresponding values with microsomes of hamster liver, where tumors do not develop by estrogen treatment, were 272.27 +/- 43.10, 222.25 +/- 21.78, or 91.36 +/- 8.54 pmol Fe2+/min, respectively. Diethylstilbestrol, equilenin, and 4-hydroxyestrone do not induce detectable iron release from ferritin under these conditions. The cytochrome P450 reductase-mediated redox cycling of DESQ, EQ, or 3,4EQ in the presence of iron resulted in the hydroxylation of benzoic acid by hydroxyl radical attack. These data demonstrate that redox cycling of estrogen metabolites releases Fe2+ from ferritin, which in tarn generates hydroxyl radicals by a Fenton reaction. This estrogen-induced hydroxyl radical damage may contribute to tumor initiation in hormone target tissues, including breast cancer. (C) 1997 Academic Press.},

A meta-analysis was performed according to total meat, red and processed meat as well as poultry and site-specific cancers. Six cohort studies and 13 case-control studies were identified. In cohort studies, most investigations found no association between total meat consumption and colon/rectal cancer, and several studies showed a weak-to-moderate positive association of red meat and processed meat consumption with colon/rectal cancer. The majority of case-control studies showed no association between total meat consumption and colon and rectal cancer; however, several ones reported a weak-to-strong positive association of red and processed consumption with colon and rectal cancer. In meta-analysis, the summary relative risks (95\% confidence interval) for the highest versus lowest categories of red meat consumption were 1.16 (1.001-1.34) and 1.21 (1.03-1.43) for colorectal and colon cancer, respectively, and those for processed meat consumption were 1.17 (1.02-1.35) and 1.23 (1.03-1.47) for colorectal and colon cancer, respectively. Poultry consumption was associated with lower risk of rectal cancer; summary relative risk (95\% confidence interval) was 0.80 (0.67-0.96). High consumption of red meat and processed meat possibly increases risk of colorectal cancer or colon cancer among the Japanese population.},

  abstract = {Iron overload is becoming an increasing problem as haemoglobinopathy patients gain greater access to good medical care and as therapies for myelodysplastic syndromes improve. Therapeutic options for iron chelation therapy have increased and many patients now receive combination therapies. However, optimal utilization of iron chelation therapy requires knowledge not only of the total body iron burden but the relative iron distribution among the different organs. The physiological basis for extrahepatic iron deposition is presented in order to help identify patients at highest risk for cardiac and endocrine complications. This manuscript reviews the current state of the art for monitoring global iron overload status as well as its compartmentalization. Plasma markers, computerized tomography, liver biopsy, magnetic susceptibility devices and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are all discussed but MRI has come to dominate clinical practice. The potential impact of recent pancreatic and pituitary MRI studies on clinical practice are discussed as well as other works-in-progress. Clinical protocols are derived from experience in haemoglobinopathies but may provide useful guiding principles for other iron overload disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndromes.},

The number of component studies in the meta-analysis, the nature of the selection mechanism, the range of variances of the effect size estimates, and the true underlying effect size are all observed to be influential in determining the power of the test. The test is fairly powerful for large meta-analyses with 75 component studies, but has only moderate power for meta-analyses with 25 component studies. However, in many of the configurations in which there is low power, there is also relatively little bias in the summary effect size estimate. Nonetheless, the test must be interpreted with caution in small meta-analyses. In particular, bias cannot be ruled out if the test is not significant. The proposed technique has potential utility as an exploratory tool for meta-analysts, as a formal procedure to complement the funnel-graph.},

  abstract = {Iron homeostasis is strictly governed in mammals; however, disordered iron metabolism (such as excess iron burden) is recognized as a risk factor for various types of diseases including cancers. Burgeoning evidence indicates that the central signaling of iron homeostasis, the hepcidin ferroportin axis, is misregulated in cancers. Nonetheless, the mechanisms of misregulated expression of iron-related genes along this signaling in cancers remain largely unknown. In the current study, we found increased levels of serum hepcidin in breast cancer patients. Reduction of hepatic hepcidin through administration of heparin restrained tumorigenic properties of breast tumor cells. Mechanistic investigation revealed that increased iron, bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP6) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) jointly promoted the synthesis of hepatic hepcidin. Tumor hepcidin expression was marginally increased in breast tumors relative to adjacent tissues. In contrast, tumor ferroportin concentration was greatly reduced in breast tumors, especially in malignant tumors, compared to adjacent tissues. Elevation of ferroportin concentration inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo by knocking down tumor hepcidin expression. Additionally, increased IL-6 was demonstrated to jointly enhance the tumorigenic effects of iron through enforcing cell growth. Our combined data overall deciphered the machinery that altered the hepcidin ferroportin signaling in breast cancers. Thus, targeting the hepcidin ferroportin signaling would represent a promising therapeutics to restrain breast cancer growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Design-A case-control study of women aged 50-65 years attending the breast assessment clinics of the breast screening programme in Southampton and Portsmouth, southern England. Data were analysed for all women requiring further clinical procedures; all women recalled to have an early rescreen; and a random sample of women found to be normal and referred for a routine rescreening appointment (standard recall). Measurements-An interview obtained information on various Lifestyle characteristics including smoking and alcohol intake, weight, waist, and hip measurements were also taken at the clinic. Women were given a detailed questionnaire on food intake to complete at home and return by post. Results-1577 women were included in the study: 220 with breast cancer (cases); 179 with benign breast disease; 353 early rescreen and 825 given a standard recall appointment. There were few differences in nutritional intake between the four groups. Logistic regression analyses were carried out comparing the dietary intake of cases with that of each control group adjusting for important demographic and reproductive factors. Results for the case and standard recall comparison are presented. The only non-calorific nutrient to reach significance was iron, which was negatively associated with risk (p=0.03). For fat intake, the odds decreased with increasing polyunsaturated fat (p=0.15), showed no trend with monounsaturated fat (p=0.37) and increased (p=0.10) with increasing saturated fat. No pattern was clear for the other calorie providing nutrients. Conclusions-In line with recent cohort studies, this study has shown no evidence to support the hypothesis that dietary fat is an important contributor to breast cancer rates. Biases should have been reduced by studying subjects from the screening programme who were at an early stage of disease.},

The effect of an element is determined by several characteristics, including absorption, metabolism, and degree of interaction with physiological processes. Iron is an essential element for almost all living organisms as it participates in a wide variety of metabolic processes, including oxygen transport, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis, and electron transport. However, as iron can form free radicals, its concentration in body tissues must be tightly regulated because in excessive amounts, it can lead to tissue damage. Disorders of iron metabolism are among the most common diseases of humans and encompass a broad spectrum of diseases with diverse clinical manifestations, ranging from anemia to iron overload, and possibly to neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the latest progress in studies of iron metabolism and bioavailability, and our current understanding of human iron requirement and consequences and causes of iron deficiency. Finally, we discuss strategies for prevention of iron deficiency.},

This review provides an overview of the importance of heme iron in the diet and discusses the two prevailing hypotheses of heme absorption; namely receptor mediated endocytosis of heme, and direct transport into the intestinal enterocyte by recently discovered heme transporters. A specific emphasis is placed on the questions surrounding the site of heme catabolism and the identity of the enzyme that performs this task. Additionally, we present the hypothesis that a non-heme iron transport protein may be required for heme iron absorption and discuss the experiences of our laboratory in examining this hypothesis.

  abstract = {Cells rely on autophagy to clear misfolded proteins and damaged organelles to maintain cellular homeostasis. In this study we use the new autophagy inhibitor PIK-III to screen for autophagy substrates. PIK-III is a selective inhibitor of VPS34 that binds a unique hydrophobic pocket not present in related kinases such as PI(3) K alpha. PIK-III acutely inhibits autophagy and de novo lipidation of LC3, and leads to the stabilization of autophagy substrates. By performing ubiquitin-affinity proteomics on PIK-III-treated cells we identified substrates including NCOA4, which accumulates in ATG7-deficient cells and co-localizes with autolysosomes. NCOA4 directly binds ferritin heavy chain-1 (FTH1) to target the iron-binding ferritin complex with a relative molecular mass of 450,000 to autolysosomes following starvation or iron depletion. Interestingly, Ncoa4(-/-) mice exhibit a profound accumulation of iron in splenic macrophages, which are critical for the reutilization of iron from engulfed red blood cells. Taken together, the results of this study provide a new mechanism for selective autophagy of ferritin and reveal a previously unappreciated role for autophagy and NCOA4 in the control of iron homeostasis in vivo.},

Twenty-one-day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into one of three experimental groups and fed a formulation of AIN-76A diet modified to be low in iron (2 p.p.m.), or the same diet supplemented with an adequate (120 p.p.m.) or excess (1200 p.p.m.) amount of iron provided as FeSO4.7H2O. Rats were maintained on their respective diets throughout the experiment which was terminated 32 weeks post carcinogen administration. Rats were injected i.p. with either 25 mg MNU/kg body wt or the saline-solvent in which MNU was dissolved at 50 days of age. In the first 14 weeks, dietary iron deficiency resulted in a low hematocrit and a decrease in weight gain. The appearance of mammary tumors was markedly suppressed in this group compared to those given in the literature that reduction in weight gain due to food restriction at a period immediately after carcinogen administration severely inhibits the subsequent development of tumors. Thus the low tumor incidence in the iron-deficient rats during this time frame could be attributed to the combined effects of low hematocrit and depressed weight gain. For the period between week 14 and week 32, the hematocrit in the iron-deficient animals was maintained at a normal level, and the body wt of these rats was comparable to that of the controls given an adequate level of iron. The rate of tumor appearance in the iron-deficient group during the second half of the experiment was similar to that of the iron-adequate group in the first half of the experiment. In other words, it appeared that once hematocrit and body wt gain were restored to normal in the iron-deficient animals, tumor incidence was only minimally affected by low dietary iron. In the second half of the experiment, the tumor incidence in the adequate iron group seemed to have plateaued, whereas it continued to rise in the excess iron group. Thus excess iron appears to be more prominent than iron deficiency in modification of mammary carcinogenesis, especially when the confounding effects of low hematocrit and reduced weight gain are taken into consideration in the latter case.},

The network accurately captures known physical and functional associations and identifies new ones, revealing remarkable regulatory potential of core spliceosomal components, related to the order and duration of their recruitment during spliceosome assembly. In contrast with standard models of regulation at early steps of splice site recognition, factors involved in catalytic activation of the spliceosome display regulatory properties.

Coherent effects of genes involved in iron homeostasis and pharmacological modulation of iron levels revealed a link between intracellular iron and Fas/CD95 exon 6 inclusion. A splicing regulatory network linked iron levels with reduced activity of the Zinc-finger-containing splicing regulator SRSF7, and in vivo and in vitro assays revealed that iron inhibits SRSF7 RNA binding.

  abstract = {Iron is abundant universally. During the evolutionary processes, humans have selected iron as a carrier of oxygen inside the body. However, iron works as a double-edged sword, and its excess is a risk for cancer, presumably via generation of reactive oxygen species. Thus far, pathological conditions such as hemochromatosis, chronic viral hepatitis B and C, exposure to asbestos fibers, as well as endometriosis have been recognized as iron overload-associated risks for human cancer. Indeed, iron is carcinogenic in animal experiments. These reports unexpectedly revealed that there are target genes in iron-induced carcinogenesis and that iron-catalyzed oxidative DNA damage is not random in vivo. Several iron transporters and hepcidin, a peptide hormone regulating iron metabolism, were discovered in the past decade. Furthermore, a recent epidemiological study reported that iron reduction by phlebotomy decreased cancer risk in the apparently normal population. These results warrant reconsideration of the role of iron in carcinogenesis and suggest that fine control of body iron stores would be a wise strategy for cancer prevention.

Autophagy preserves organelle function, prevents the toxic buildup of cellular waste products, and provides substrates to sustain metabolism in starvation. Although in some contexts autophagy suppresses tumorigenesis, in most contexts autophagy facilitates tumorigenesis. Cancers can upregulate autophagy to survive microenvironmental stress and to increase growth and aggressiveness. Mechanisms by which autophagy promotes cancer include suppressing induction of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and maintaining metabolic function of mitochondria. Efforts to inhibit autophagy to improve cancer therapy have thereby attracted great interest.},

  abstract = {Epidemiology shows that red and processed meat intake is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Heme iron, heterocyclic amines, and endogenous N-nitroso compounds (NOC) are proposed to explain this effect, but their relative contribution is unknown. Our study aimed at determining, at nutritional doses, which is the main factor involved and proposing a mechanism of cancer promotion by red meat. The relative part of heme iron (1\% in diet), heterocyclic amines (PhIP + MeIQx, 50 + 25 mu g/kg in diet), and NOC (induced by NaNO2 + NaNO3; 0.17 + 0.23 g/L of drinking water) was determined by a factorial design and preneoplastic endpoints in chemically induced rats and validated on tumors in Min mice. The molecular mechanisms (genotoxicity, cytotoxicity) were analyzed in vitro in normal and Apc-deficient cell lines and confirmed on colon mucosa. Heme iron increased the number of preneoplastic lesions, but dietary heterocyclic amines and NOC had no effect on carcinogenesis in rats. Dietary hemoglobin increased tumor load in Min mice (control diet: 67 +/- 39 mm(2); 2.5\% hemoglobin diet: 114 +/- 47 mm(2), P = 0.004). In vitro, fecal water from rats given hemoglobin was rich in aldehydes and was cytotoxic to normal cells, but not to premalignant cells. The aldehydes 4-hydroxynonenal and 4-hydroxyhexenal were more toxic to normal versus mutated cells and were only genotoxic to normal cells. Genotoxicity was also observed in colon mucosa of mice given hemoglobin. These results highlight the role of heme iron in the promotion of colon cancer by red meat and suggest that heme iron could initiate carcinogenesis through lipid peroxidation. (C)2015 AACR.},

Meta-analyses are increasingly used to address this problem, and they often evaluate observational studies. A workshop was held in Atlanta, Ga, in April 1997, to examine the reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies and to make recommendations to aid authors, reviewers, editors, and readers. Participants Twenty-seven participants were selected by a steering committee, based on expertise in clinical practice, trials, statistics, epidemiology, social sciences, and biomedical editing. Deliberations of the workshop were open to other interested scientists. Funding for this activity was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Evidence We conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the conduct and reporting of meta-analyses in observational studies using MEDLINE, Educational Research Information Center (ERIC), PsycLIT, and the Current Index to Statistics. We also examined reference lists of the 32 studies retrieved and contacted experts in the field. Participants were assigned to small-group discussions on the subjects of bias, searching and abstracting, heterogeneity, study categorization, and statistical methods. Consensus Process From the material presented at the workshop, the authors developed a checklist summarizing recommendations for reporting meta-analyses of observational studies. The checklist and supporting evidence were circulated to all conference attendees and additional experts. All suggestions for revisions were addressed. Conclusions The proposed checklist contains specifications for reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology, including background, search strategy, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Use of the checklist should improve the usefulness of meta-analyses for authors, reviewers, editors, readers, and decision makers. An evaluation plan is suggested and research areas are explored.},

  abstract = {Iron metabolism is essential for many cellular processes, including oxygen transport, respiration and DNA synthesis, and many cancer cells exhibit dysregulation in iron metabolism. Maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis is regulated by iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), which control the expression of iron-related genes by binding iron-responsive elements (IREs) of target mRNAs. Here, we report that mitochondrial SIRT3 regulates cellular iron metabolism by modulating IRP1 activity. SIRT3 loss increases reactive oxygen species production, leading to elevated IRP1 binding to IREs. As a consequence, IRP1 target genes, such as the transferrin receptor (TfR1), a membrane-associated glycoprotein critical for iron uptake and cell proliferation, are controlled by SIRT3. Importantly, SIRT3 deficiency results in a defect in cellular iron homeostasis. SIRT3 null cells contain high levels of iron and lose iron-dependent TfR1 regulation. Moreover, SIRT3 null mice exhibit higher levels of iron and TfR1 expression in the pancreas. We found that the regulation of iron uptake and TfR1 expression contribute to the tumor-suppressive activity of SIRT3. Indeed, SIRT3 expression is negatively correlated with TfR1 expression in human pancreatic cancers. SIRT3 overexpression decreases TfR1 expression by inhibiting IRP1 and represses proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells. Our data uncover a novel role of SIRT3 in cellular iron metabolism through IRP1 regulation and suggest that SIRT3 functions as a tumor suppressor, in part, by modulating cellular iron metabolism.},

Relevant prospective cohort studies were identified by searching PubMed through October 31, 2014, and by reviewing the reference lists of retrieved articles. Study-specific relative risk (RR) estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Fourteen prospective studies on red meat (involving 31,552 cases) and 12 prospective studies on processed meat were included in the meta-analysis. The summary RRs (95 \% CI) of breast cancer for the highest versus the lowest categories were 1.10 (1.02, 1.19) for red meat, and 1.08 (1.01, 1.15) for processed meat. The estimated summary RRs (95 \% CI) were 1.11 (1.05, 1.16) for an increase of 120 g/day of red meat, and 1.09 (1.03, 1.16) for an increase of 50 g/day of processed meat.

Synthesis of hepcidin in prostate cancer is controlled by a unique intersection of pathways that involves BMP4/7, IL6, Wnt, and the dual BMP and Wnt antagonist, SOSTDC1. Epigenetic silencing of SOSTDC1 through methylation is increased in prostate cancer and is associated with accelerated disease progression in patients with prostate cancer.

The correlation of all these major diseases with dietary red meat indicates the presence of factors in red meat that damage biological components. This hypothesis will focus on the biochemistry of heme compounds and their oxidative processes. Raw red meat contains high levels of oxymyoglobin and deoxymyoglobin and oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and cytochromes in muscle and other tissues. Cooked and processed meat contain hemichromes and hemochromes. After being eaten heme proteins are hydrolyzed to amino acids and peptides and the heme group which is coordinated with strong ligands. The iron of heme coordinates to the sulfur, nitrogen or oxygen of amino acids and peptides and other biological components. The coordinated heme groups are absorbed and transported by the blood to every organ and tissue. Free and coordinated heme preferentially catalyze oxidative reactions. Heme catalyzed oxidations can damage lipids, proteins, DNA and other nucleic acids and various components of biological systems. Heme catalysis with hydroperoxide intermediates can initiate further oxidations some of which would result in oxidative chain reactions. Biochemical and tissue free radical damage caused by heme catalyzed oxidations is similar to that resulting from ionizing radiation. Oxidative biochemical damage is widespread in diseases. It is apparent that decreasing the amount of dietary red meat will limit the level of oxidative catalysts in the tissues of the body. Increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits elevates the levels of antioxidative components, for example, selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, lycopene, cysteine-glutathione and various phytochemicals. These detrimental processes of heme catalysis of oxidative damage hypothesized here are not well recognized. More investigative studies in this field need to be done. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Although previous studies suggest that myeloid zinc-finger 1 (MZF-1) is a multifaceted transcription factor that may function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, the molecular bases determining its different traits remain elusive. Increasing evidence suggests that disorders in iron metabolism affect tumorigenesis and tumor behaviors, and that excess tumor iron stimulates tumor progression through various mechanisms such as enhancing DNA replication and energy metabolism. Ferroportin (FPN) is the only known iron exporter in mammalian cells, and it determines global iron egress out of cells. FPN reduction leads to decreased iron efflux and increased intracellular iron that consequentially aggravates the oncogenic effects of iron. MZF-1 was recently identified as a transcription factor that regulates FPN expression. Thus far, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the MZF-1-FPN signaling in cancers are largely unknown. Here, we found a significant reduction of FPN levels in prostate tumors relative to adjacent tissues, and demonstrated a crucial role of FPN in tumor growth through controlling tumor iron concentration. Inhibition of MZF-1 expression led to reduced FPN concentration, coupled with resultant intracellular iron retention, increased iron-related cellular activities and enhanced tumor cell growth. In contrast, increase of MZF-1 expression restrained tumor cell growth by promoting FPN-driven iron egress. Importantly, we demonstrated that AP4 and c-Myb jointly modulated MZF-1 transcription, and that miR-492 was also directly involved in regulating MZF-1 concentration through binding to the 3' untranslated regions of its mRNA. These results correlate with reduced AP4 and c-Myb expression and elevated miR-492 expression found in prostate tumors as compared with adjacent tissues that resulted in diminished MZF-1 and FPN. Moreover, we demonstrated that alterations of AP4, c-Myb and miR-492 levels significantly affected tumor cell growth. Targeting molecules within the MZF-1-FPN signaling thus appears to be a promising approach to restrain prostate cancer.},

The objectives of this study were to compare the prevalence of nutrient adequacy and percent of intakes greater than the UL from diet alone between supplement users and nonusers and determine the contribution of supplements to nutrient intakes. Dietary intakes (24-h recall) and supplement use (previous 30 d) from respondents {$>$}= 1 y in the Canadian Community Health Survey 2.2 (n = 34,381) were used to estimate the prevalence of nutrient adequacy and intakes greater than the UL.

The prevalence of nutrient adequacy from diet alone was not significantly higher among supplement users than nonusers for any nutrient. Based on diet alone, children 1-13 y had a low prevalence of nutrient adequacy ({$<$}30\%) except for vitamin D and calcium. Among respondents {$>$}= 14 y, inadequacies of vitamins A and D, calcium, and magnesium were {$>$}30\%. For other nutrients, there was a low prevalence of nutrient adequacy. There were no nutrient intakes greater than the UL from diet alone, except zinc in children.

  abstract = {Although the association between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC) is well established, the association across subsites of the colon and rectum remains uncertain, as does time of consumption in relation to cancer development. As these relationships are key for understanding the pathogenesis of CRC, they were examined in two large cohorts with repeated dietary measures over time, the Nurses' Health Study (n = 87,108 women, 1980-2010) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (n = 47,389 men, 1986-2010). Cox proportional hazards regression models generated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), which were pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. In combined cohorts, there were 2,731 CRC cases (1,151 proximal colon, 816 distal colon, and 589 rectum). In pooled analyses, processed red meat was positively associated with CRC risk (per 1 serving/day increase: HR = 1.15, 95\% CI: 1.01-1.32; P for trend 0.03) and particularly with distal colon cancer (per 1 serving/day increase; HR = 1.36; 95\% CI: 1.09-1.69; P for trend 0.006). Recent consumption of processed meat (within the past 4 years) was not associated with distal cancer. Unprocessed red meat was inversely associated with risk of distal colon cancer and a weak non-significant positive association between unprocessed red meat and proximal cancer was observed (per 1 serving/day increase: distal HR = 0.75; 95\% CI: 0.68-0.82; P for trend {$<$}0.001; proximal HR = 1.14, 95\% CI: 0.92-1.40; P for trend 0.22). Thus, in these two large cohorts of US health professionals, processed meat intake was positively associated with risk of CRC, particularly distal cancer, with little evidence that higher intake of unprocessed red meat substantially increased risk of CRC. Future studies, particularly those with sufficient sample size to assess associations by subsites across the colon are needed to confirm these findings and elucidate potentially distinct mechanisms underlying the relationship between processed meat and subtypes of unprocessed red meat with CRC.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that deregulated hepcidin-ferroportin (FPN) signaling is associated with the increased risk of cancers. However, the effects of deregulated hepcidin-FPN signaling on tumor behaviors such as metastasis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) have not been closely investigated. In this study, LL/2 cancer cells were found to exhibit an impaired propensity to home into lungs, and a reduced ability to develop tumors was also demonstrated in lungs of Hamp1(-/-) mice. Moreover, hepatic hepcidin deficiency was found to considerably favor tumor-free survival in Hamp1(-/-) mice, compared with wild-type mice. These data thus underscored a contributive role of hepatic hepcidin in promoting lung cancer cell homing and fostering tumor progression. To explore the role of FPN in regulating tumor progression, we genetically engineered 4T1 cells with FPN over-expression upon induction by doxycycline. With this cell line, it was discovered that increased FPN expression reduced cell division and colony formation in vitro, without eliciting significant cell death. Analogously, FPN over-expression impeded tumor growth and metastasis to lung and liver in mice. At the molecular level, FPN over-expression was identified to undermine DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. Importantly, FPN over-expression inhibited EMT, as reflected by the significant decrease of representative EMT markers, such as Snail1, Twist1, ZEB2, and vimentin. Additionally, there was also a reduction of lactate production in cells upon induction of FPN over-expression. Together, our results highlighted a crucial role of the hepcidin-FPN signaling in modulating tumor growth and metastasis, providing new evidence to understand the contribution of this signaling in cancers.},

A significantly greater proportion of carcinomas in rats fed the excess iron diet had the normal Ha-ras gene rather than the mutated form (G--{$>$}A transition mutation in codon 12). In non-tumor bearing rats, mammary epithelial cells in lobules were the primary site of iron accumulation. However, in mammary carcinomas, a shift in the distribution of iron from the epithelial cells to the stroma was noted. Iron was predominantly found in tumor stroma; malignant epithelial cells failed to accumulate comparable levels of iron. These observations indicate that in the presence of excess iron there is an increase in the number of mammary carcinomas that do not bear the mutant Ha-ras gene. Whether changes in the distribution of iron within the mammary gland contribute to the altered pathogenetic characteristics of these tumors is being investigated.},

This study reports the discovery of multiple molecular components of ferroptosis and its intimate interplay with cellular metabolism and redox machinery. Nutrient starvation often leads to sporadic apoptosis. Strikingly, we found that upon deprivation of amino acids, a more rapid and potent necrosis process can be induced in a serum-dependent manner, which was subsequently determined to be ferroptosis. Two serum factors, the iron-carrier protein transferrin and amino acid glutamine, were identified as the inducers of ferroptosis. We further found that the cell surface transferrin receptor and the glutamine-fueled intracellular metabolic pathway, glutaminolysis, played crucial roles in the death process. Inhibition of glutaminolysis, the essential component of ferroptosis, can reduce heart injury triggered by ischemia/reperfusion, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for treating related diseases.},

  abstract = {To investigate the relation between selected micronutrients and breast cancer risk, we conducted a case control study of breast cancer between June 1991 and April 1994 in 6 Italian areas. The study included 2569 women admitted to the major teaching and general hospitals of the study areas with histologically confirmed incident breast cancer and 2588 control women with no history of cancer, who were admitted to hospitals in the same catchment areas for acute, non-neoplastic, nongynecological conditions unrelated to hormonal or digestive tract diseases or to long-term modifications of the diet. Dietary habits, including alcoholic beverage consumption, were investigated using a validated food frequency questionnaire, including 78 foods or food groups, several types of alcoholic beverages, some ''fat intake pattern'' questions and some open sections for foods consumed frequently by the subject and not reported in the questionnaire. To control for potential confounding factors, several multiple logistic regression models were used. When major correlates, energy intake and the mutual confounding effect of the various micronutrients were taken into account, beta-carotene, vitamin E and calcium showed a significant inverse association with breast cancer risk. The estimated odds ratios of the 5th quintile compared to the lowest one were 0.84 for beta-carotene, 0.75 for vitamin E and 0.81 for calcium. No significant association emerged for retinol, vitamin C, thiamin, riboflavin, iron and potassium. Our results suggest that a diet rich in several micronutrients, particularly beta-carotene, vitamin E and calcium, may be protective against breast cancer. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Although it appears biologically plausible for iron to be associated with gastric carcinogenesis, the evidence is insufficient to lead to any conclusions. To further investigate the relationship between body iron status and gastric cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study in the multicentric European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. The study included 456 primary incident gastric adenocarcinoma cases and 900 matched controls that occurred during an average of 11 years of follow-up. We measured prediagnostic serum iron, ferritin, transferrin and C-reactive protein, and further estimated total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation (TS). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of gastric cancer by iron metrics were estimated from multivariable conditional logistic regression models. After adjusting for relevant confounders, we observed a statistically significant inverse association between gastric cancer and ferritin and TS indices (ORlog2=0.80, 95\% CI=0.72-0.88; OR10\%increment=0.87, 95\% CI=0.78-0.97, respectively). These associations appear to be restricted to noncardia gastric cancer (ferritin showed a p for heterogeneity=0.04 and TS had a p for heterogeneity=0.02), and no differences were found by histological type. TIBC increased risk of overall gastric cancer (OR50 mu g/dl=1.13, 95\% CI=1.02-1.2) and also with noncardia gastric cancer (p for heterogeneity=0.04). Additional analysis suggests that time between blood draw and gastric cancer diagnosis could modify these findings. In conclusion, our results showed a decreased risk of gastric cancer related to higher body iron stores as measured by serum iron and ferritin. Further investigation is needed to clarify the role of iron in gastric carcinogenesis. What's new? Iron is highly reactive, iron levels in the body rise with inflammation, and the iron-overload disorder hemochromatosis is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. Thus, one might predict that high levels of iron will increase the risk of cancer. However, in this study from a large European population, the authors found that increased body iron stores actually decreased the risk of gastric cancer. These results suggest that further investigation is needed to clarify the role of iron in gastric carcinogenesis.},

While this is evident in regions with high rates of malnutrition and infectious disease, the extent of reproductive-related changes is less well known in countries with low rates of iron deficiency anemia, such as the United States. The goal of this study is determine the relationship between women's reproductive variables (pregnancy, parity, currently breastfeeding, regular menstruation, hormonal contraceptive use, and age at menarche) and iron status (hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin receptor, and \% transferrin saturation) using an anthropological framework for interpreting the results. Data from women aged 18-49 were taken from the 1999-2006 US NHANES, a nationally representative cross-sectional sample of US women. Using multiple imputation and complex survey statistics, women's reproductive variables were regressed against indicators of iron status. Pregnant women had significantly poorer iron status, by most indicators, than non-pregnant women. All biomarkers demonstrated significantly lower iron levels with increasing parity. Women who were having regular periods had iron indicators that suggested decreased iron levels, while women who used hormonal contraceptives had iron indicators that suggested increased iron levels. Despite relatively good iron status and widespread availability of iron-rich foods in the US, women still exhibit patterns of iron depletion across several reproductive variables of interest. These results contribute to an ecological approach to iron status that seeks to understand variation in iron status, with the hopes that appropriate, population-specific recommendations can be developed to improve women's health.},

  abstract = {The discovery of hepcidin in 2000 and the subsequent unprecedented explosion of research and discoveries in the iron field have dramatically changed our understanding of human disorders of iron metabolism. Today, hereditary hemochromatosis, the paradigmatic iron-loading disorder, is recognized as an endocrine disease due to the genetic loss of hepcidin, the iron hormone produced by the liver. This syndrome is due to unchecked transfer of iron into the bloodstream in the absence of increased erythropoietic needs and its toxic effects in parenchymatous organs. It is caused by mutations that affect any of the proteins that help hepcidin to monitor serum iron, including HFE and, in rarer instances, transferrin-receptor 2 and hemojuvelin, or make its receptor ferroportin, resistant to the hormone. In Caucasians, C282Y HFE homozygotes are numerous, but they are only predisposed to hemochromatosis; complete organ disease develops in a minority, due to alcohol abuse or concurrent genetic modifiers that are now being identified. HFE gene testing can be used to diagnose hemochromatosis in symptomatic patients, but analyses of liver histology and full gene sequencing are required to identify patients with rare, non-HFE forms of the disease. Due to the central pathogenic role of hepcidin, it is anticipated that nongenetic causes of hepcidin loss (eg, end-stage liver disease) can cause acquired forms of hemochromatosis. The mainstay of hemochromatosis management is still removal of iron by phlebotomy, first introduced in 1950s, but identification of hepcidin has not only shed new light on the pathogenesis of the disease and the approach to diagnosis, but etiologic therapeutic applications from these advances are now foreseen.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer remains a significant public health concern among men in the U.S. and worldwide. Epidemiologic studies have generally produced inconclusive results for dietary risk factors for prostate cancer, including consumption of red and processed meats. We aimed to update a previous meta-analysis of prospective cohorts of red and processed meats and prostate cancer with the inclusion of new and updated cohort studies, as well as evaluate meat cooking methods, heme iron, and heterocyclic amine (HCA) intake exposure data. A comprehensive literature search was performed and 26 publications from 19 different cohort studies were included. Random effects models were used to calculate summary relative risk estimates (SRREs) for high vs. low exposure categories. Additionally, meta-regression analyses and stratified intake analyses were conducted to evaluate dose-response relationships. The SRREs for total prostate cancer and total red meat consumption, fresh red meat consumption, and processed meat consumption were 1.02 (95 \% CI: 0.92-1.12), 1.06 (95 \% CI: 0.97-1.16), and 1.05 (95 \% CI: 1.01-1.10), respectively. Analyses were also conducted for the outcomes of non-advanced, advanced, and fatal prostate cancer when sufficient data were available, but these analyses did not produce significant results. No significant SRREs were observed for any of the meat cooking methods, HCA, or heme iron analyses. Dose-response analyses did not reveal significant patterns of associations between red or processed meat and prostate cancer. In conclusion, the results from our analyses do not support an association between red meat or processed consumption and prostate cancer, although we observed a weak positive summary estimate for processed meats.},

We performed a critical review of scientific literature, to describe the findings of meta-analyses that explored the association between meat consumption and cancer risk. Overall, 42 eligible meta-analyses were included in this review, in which meat consumption was assumed from sheer statistics. Convincing association was found between larger intake of red meat and cancer, especially with colorectal, lung, esophageal and gastric malignancies. Increased consumption of processed meat was also found to be associated with colorectal, esophageal, gastric and bladder cancers. Enhanced intake of white meat or poultry was found to be negatively associated with some types of cancers. Larger beef consumption was significantly associated with cancer, whereas the risk was not increased consuming high amounts of pork. Our analysis suggest increased risk of cancer in subjects consuming large amounts of red and processed meat, but not in those with high intake of white meat or poultry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

  abstract = {Associations between specific red meat subtypes and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been investigated in a number of epidemiological studies. However, no publication to date has summarised the overall epidemiological evidence. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies (cohort, nested case-control or case-cohort studies), which reported relative risk (RR) estimates and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between intake of meat subtypes with colorectal, colon or rectal cancer or colorectal adenoma risk. PubMed and ISI Web of Science were searched up until August 1, 2014. Nineteen studies examined meat subtypes (5 beef, 5 pork, 2 lamb, 1 veal and 19 poultry) and associations with colorectal, colon or rectal cancer risk and 4 studies examined associations with adenoma risk (1 beef and 4 poultry). Comparing highest versus lowest intake, beef consumption was associated with an increased risk of CRC (RR = 1.11, 95\% CI = 1.01 to 1.22) and colon cancer (RR = 1.24, 95\% CI = 1.07 to 1.44), but no association was found with rectal cancer (RR = 0.95, 95\% CI = 0.78 to 1.16). Higher consumption of lamb was also associated with increased risk of CRC (RR = 1.24, 95\% CI = 1.08 to 1.44). No association was observed for pork (RR = 1.07, 95\% CI = 0.90 to 1.27), but some between study heterogeneity was observed. No association was observed for poultry consumption and risk of colorectal adenomas or cancer. This meta-analysis suggests that red meat subtypes differ in their association with CRC and its sub sites. Further analysis of data from prospective cohort studies is warranted, especially regarding the role of pork.},

  abstract = {Background: Data on the determinants of body iron stores in middle-aged women are sparse. Objective: We prospectively evaluated nondietary and dietary determinants of iron stores. Design: Using blood samples collected in 1989-1990, we measured plasma ferritin concentrations in 620 healthy postmenopausal women aged 44-69 y who participated in the Nurses' Health Study. Food-frequency questionnaires completed in 1980, 1984, and 1986 were used to calculate average dietary intakes. Generalized linear regression and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the association between plasma ferritin and its determinants. Results: Among these postmenopausal women, the median plasma ferritin concentration was 73.8 ng/mL (interquartile range: 41.6 - 125.8 ng/mL), 2.7\% were iron depleted (ferritin concentration {$<$} 12 ng/mL), and 9.8\% had an elevated ferritin concentration ({$>$} 200 ng/mL). Age, time since menopause, time since the last postmenopausal hormone (PMH) use, body mass index, iron supplement use, and alcohol and heme-iron intakes were positively associated with ferritin concentrations, whereas PMH use, physical activity, aspirin use, and gastrointestinal ulcer were inversely related. The association between heme-iron intake and ferritin was most apparent among the women who consumed {$>$} 30 g alcohol/d. Conclusions: Our prospective data confirm that in postmenopausal women, intakes of heme iron, supplemental iron, and alcohol are dietary determinants of plasma ferritin, and age, PMH use, body mass index, physical activity, aspirin use, and gastrointestinal ulcer are nondietary determinants.},

  abstract = {This study identifies BNIP3L as the key regulator of p53-dependent cell death mechanism in colon cancer cells targeted by the novel gallium based anticancer drug, KP46. KP46 specifically accumulated into mitochondria where it caused p53-dependent morphological and functional damage impairing mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics. Furthermore, competing with iron for cellular uptake, KP46 lowered the intracellular labile iron pools and intracellular heme. Accordingly, p53 accumulated in the nucleus where it activated its transcriptional target BNIP3L, a BH3 only domain protein with functions in apoptosis and mitophagy. Upregulated BNIP3L sensitized the mitochondrial permeability transition and strongly induced PARKIN-mediated mitochondrial clearance and cellular vacuolization. Downregulation of BNIP3L entirely rescued cell viability caused by exposure of KP46 for 24 hours, confirming that early induced cell death was regulated by BNIP3L. Altogether, targeting BNIP3L in wild-type p53 colon cancer cells is a novel anticancer strategy activating iron depletion signaling and the mitophagy-related cell death pathway.},

Consistent with this concept, multiple forms of oxygen radical-generated DNA damage are induced by estrogen in cell-free systems, in cells in culture and in rodents prone to estrogen-induced cancer. Metal ions, specifically iron, are necessary for the production of hydroxy radicals. Iron has not received much attention in discussions of estrogen-induced carcinogenesis and human hormone-associated cancer, and is the focus of this review. An elevated dietary iron intake enhances the incidence of carcinogen-induced mammary cancer in rats and estrogen-induced kidney tumors in Syrian hamsters. Estrogen administration increases iron accumulation in hamsters and facilitates iron uptake by cells in culture. In humans, elevated body iron storage has been shown to increase the risk of several cancers including breast cancer. A role of iron in hormone-associated cancer in humans offers attractive routes for cancer prevention by regulating metal ion metabolism and interfering with iron accumulation in tissues.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown inconsistent associations between red and processed meat intake and breast cancer risk. N-nitroso compounds and heme iron have been hypothesized as contributing factors. We followed 193,742 postmenopausal women in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study and identified 9,305 incident breast cancers (1995-2006). Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire at baseline. We adjusted daily intakes of meat, nitrite and heme iron for energy intake using the nutrient density method. We estimated multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) by quintiles of dietary exposures for all breast cancer, by stage (in-situ, localized, regional/distant) and by estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status using Cox proportional hazards regression. Total red meat intake was positively associated with risk of regional/distant cancer (p-trend = 0.02). The risk was 25\% higher in the highest vs. lowest intake quintile (95\% CI = 1.03-1.52). Higher processed red meat intake (Q5 vs. Q1) was associated with 27\% higher risk of localized breast cancer (95\% CI = 1.01-1.27, p-trend = 0.03) and a 19\% higher risk of regional/distant cancer (95\% CI = 0.98-1.44, p-trend = 0.10). In addition, higher nitrite intake from processed red meat was positively associated with localized cancer (HR for Q5 vs. Q1 = 1.23, 95\% CI = 1.09-1.39, p-trend {$<$} 0.0001). Heme iron intake was positively associated with breast cancer risk overall and all cancer stages (p-trend = 0.02-0.05). No heterogeneity was observed in risk associations by hormone receptor status. Our findings suggest that high consumption of red meat and processed meat may increase risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Added nitrite and heme iron may partly contribute to these observed associations.},

We assessed total, red, white and processed meat intake, meat cooking methods and doneness and heme iron and mutagen intake in relation to pancreatic cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort. A total of 322,846 participants (187,265 men and 135,581 women) successfully completed and returned the food frequency questionnaire between 1995 and 1996. After a mean follow-up of 9.2 years (up to 10.17 years), 1,417 individuals (895 men and 522 women) developed exocrine pancreatic cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), and trends were calculated using the median value of each quantile. Models incorporated age as the time metric and were adjusted for smoking history, body mass index, self-reported diabetes and energy-adjusted saturated fat. Pancreatic cancer risk significantly increased with intake of total meat (Q5 vs. Q1: HR=1.20, 95\% CI 1.02-1.42, p-trend=0.03), red meat (HR=1.22, 95\% CI 1.01-1.48, p-trend=0.02), high-temperature cooked meat (HR=1.21, 95\% CI 1.00-1.45, p-trend=0.02), grilled/barbequed meat (HR=1.24, 95\% CI 1.03-1.50, p-trend=0.007), well/very well done meat (HR=1.32, 95\% CI 1.10-1.58, p-trend=0.005) and heme iron from red meat (Q4 vs. Q1: HR=1.21, 95\% CI 1.01-1.45, p-trend=0.04). When stratified by sex, these associations remained significant in men but not women except for white meat intake in women (HR=1.33, 95\% CI 1.02-1.74, p-trend=0.04). Additional studies should confirm our findings that consuming heme iron from red meat increases pancreatic cancer risk. What's new? How would you like your steak? A new study examines whether meat cooking techniques boost pancreatic cancer risk. The comprehensive investigation also looked at total meat intake; meat intake by type; as well as heme iron and meat mutagen intake, using data from a questionnaire given to more than 567,000 persons. Of these, 1417 developed pancreatic cancer. Analysis showed that higher risk of pancreatic cancer accompanies total meat consumption, high temperature cooking, grilled meat, well done meat, red meat, and heme iron intake. This is the largest study yet to evaluate the link between meat cooking methods, heme iron, and pancreatic cancer.},

Serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation levels were studied for their prediction of different cancers in a cohort of 41,276 men and women aged 20-74 years and initially free from cancer. During a mean follow-up of 14 years, 2,469 primary cancer cases were diagnosed. Excess risks of colorectal and lung cancers were found in subjects with transferrin saturation level exceeding 60\%. The relative risks, adjusted for age, sex and smoking, were 3.04 for colorectal cancer and 1.51 for lung cancer, in comparison with subjects having lower levels. The risk of lung cancer was inversely related to serum TIBC, with a relative risk between the highest and lowest quartiles of 0.69 for men and 0.19 for women. For the risk of stomach cancer, we detected inverse relationships with serum iron and with transferrin saturation and a positive relationship with TIBC, but these associations weakened when the cancer cases occurring during the 5 first years of follow-up were excluded. High iron stores may increase the risk of colorectal cancer, whereas low iron stores may be an early sign of occult stomach cancer. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Essential metals, such as iron and copper, play a critical role in a plethora of cellular processes including cell growth and proliferation. However, concomitantly, excess of these metal ions in the body can have deleterious effects due to their ability to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, the human body has evolved a very well orchestrated metabolic system that keeps tight control on the levels of these metal ions. Considering their very high proliferation rate, cancer cells require a high abundance of these metals compared to their normal counterparts. Interestingly, new anti-cancer agents that take advantage of the sensitivity of cancer cells to metal sequestration and their susceptibility to ROS have been developed. These ligands can avidly bind metal ions to form redox active metal complexes, which lead to generation of cytotoxic ROS. Furthermore, these agents also act as potent metastasis suppressors due to their ability to up-regulate the metastasis suppressor gene, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1. This review discusses the importance of iron and copper in the metabolism and progression of cancer, how they can be exploited to target tumors and the clinical translation of novel anti-cancer chemotherapeutics.

  abstract = {Iron is an essential element and a critical component of molecules involved in energy production, cell cycle and intermediate metabolism. However, the same characteristic chemistry that makes it so biologically versatile may lead to iron-associated toxicity as a consequence of increased oxidative stress. The fact that free iron accumulates with age and generates ROS led to the hypothesis that it could be involved in the etiogenesis of several chronic diseases. Iron has been consistently linked to carcinogenesis, either through persistent failure in the redox balance or due to its critical role in cellular proliferation. Several reports have given evidence that alterations in the import, export and storage of cellular iron may contribute to breast cancer development, behavior and recurrence. In this review, we summarize the basic mechanisms of systemic and cellular iron regulation and highlight the findings that link their deregulation with breast cancer. To conclude, progresses in iron chelation therapy in breast cancer, as a tool to fight chemotherapy resistance, are also reviewed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: This study investigated the prognostic impact of serum ferritin for survival in patients with relapsed or refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Methods: This retrospective cohort study reviewed clinicopathological characteristics and laboratory biomarkers in 120 mCRC patients being treated with Korean Medicine (KM). The overall survival (OS) of patients was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and statistical significance was assessed using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses of Cox proportional hazards regression were used to evaluate the prognostic impact for survival in relapsed or refractory mCRC patients. Results: Of the patients, 62.5\% had liver metastases, 74.1\% underwent greater than second-line chemotherapy, and 80.8\% underwent surgery. Median OS was 7.6 months for all patients after the initiation of KM treatment, which was begun 13.7 months, on average, after mCRC diagnosis. Concerning prognostic factors such as the presence of liver metastasis (p = 0.024), high carcinoembryonic antigen level (CEA {$>$} 5 ng/mL, p = 0.044), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP {$>$}= 10.0 mg/L, p = 0.000), high absolute monocyte count (AMC {$>$} 413.3 cells/mu L, p = 0.034), elevated serum ferritin (ferritin = 150 ng/mL, p = 0.002), low hemoglobin level (Hb {$<$} 12 g/dL, p = 0.026) and low albumin (albumin {$<$} 3.5 g/dL, p = 0.003) were associated with increased hazard ratios and poor survival. According to the multivariate proportional hazards model with backward and forward manners, albumin (albumin {$<$} 3.5 g/dL; hazard ratio (HR) 2.218, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.135 -3.990, p = 0.019), CRP (CRP {$>$}= 10.0 mg/L; HR 2.506, 95\% CI 1.644 -3.822, p = 0.000), CEA (CEA {$>$} 5 ng/mL; HR 2.040, 95\% CI 1.203 - 3.460, p = 0.008), and serum ferritin (ferritin {$>$}= 150 ng/mL; HR 1.763, 95\% CI 1.169 - 2.660, p = 0.007) were independent prognostic biomarkers of survival in mCRC patients. Conclusions: These results indicate that serum ferritin acts as an independent prognostic biomarker for survival in relapsed or refractory mCRC patients.},

  abstract = {Dietary fats and other constituents have been studied extensively in relation to breast cancer risk. Iron, an essential micronutrient with pro-oxidant properties, has received little attention, and specific fats may augment its toxicity. We investigated the effects of iron and fats from various food sources on the risk of breast cancer. Participants in a population-based case-control study, 3,452 breast cancer cases, and 3,474 age-frequency-matched controls, completed in-person interviews, including a detailed food-frequency questionnaire. Plant- and animal-derived iron and fat intakes were derived from dietary intake data and food composition tables. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to study the independent and interactive effects of different forms of iron and fats on breast cancer risk. Animal-derived (largely heme) iron intake was positively associated with breast cancer risk (P (trend) {$<$} 0.01; OR = 1.49 in the highest vs. lowest quartile, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.78) after adjustment for known risk factors, antioxidant vitamin and isoflavone intake, and vitamin supplement use. The effect of animal-derived iron was similar in pre- and postmenopausal women. Intake of animal-derived fats was also associated with increased risk (adjusted OR = 1.34, 95\% CI 1.14-1.58), particularly after menopause. A significant interaction between iron and fat from animal sources was observed (P {$<$} 0.01). A high intake of animal-derived (heme) iron may be associated with an increased risk of primary breast cancer in Chinese women, and saturated and mono-unsaturated fats that are also derived from animal sources may augment this effect. Combined reductions in animal-derived iron and fat consumption have the potential to reduce breast cancer risk.},

  abstract = {The glutamate transporter xCT (SCL7a11, system Xc-, SXC) is an emerging key player in glutamate/cysteine/glutathione homeostasis in the brain and in cancer. xCT expression correlates with the grade of malignancy. Here, we report on the use of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and EMA-approved xCT inhibitor, sulfasalazine (SAS) in gliomas. SAS does not affect cell viability in gliomas at concentrations below 200 mu M. At higher concentrations SAS becomes gliomatoxic. Mechanistically SAS inhibits xCT and induces ferroptotic cell death in glioma cells. There is no evidence for impact on autophagic flux following SAS application. However, SAS can potentiate the efficacy of the standard chemotherapeutic and autophagy-inducing agent temozolomide (Temcat, Temodal or Temodar (R)). We also investigated SAS in non-transformed cellular constituents of the brain. Neurons and brain tissue are almost non-responding to SAS whereas isolated astrocytes are less sensitive towards SAS toxicity compared to gliomas. In vivo SAS treatment does not affect experimental tumor growth and treated animals revealed comparable tumor volume as untreated controls. However, SAS treatment resulted in reduced glioma-derived edema and, hence, total tumor volume burden as revealed by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Altogether, we show that SAS can be utilized for targeting the glutamate antiporter xCT activity as a tumor microenvironment-normalizing drug, while crucial cytotoxic effects in brain tumors are minor.},

Using Cox proportional hazards models, we found no association of iron or heme iron intake with risk of breast cancer overall, in wornen consuming 30+ g of alcohol per day, or in women who had ever used hormone replacement therapy. The present study offers no support for an association of iron or heme iron intake with breast cancer risk or for a modification by iron of the effect of alcohol or estrogen.

Here, we report the crucial role of autophagy, particularly autophagic degradation of cellular iron storage proteins (a process known as ferritinophagy), in ferroptosis. Using RNAi screening coupled with subsequent genetic analysis, we identified multiple autophagy-related genes as positive regulators of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis induction led to autophagy activation and consequent degradation of ferritin and ferritinophagy cargo receptor NCOA4. Consistently, inhibition of ferritinophagy by blockage of autophagy or knockdown of NCOA4 abrogated the accumulation of ferroptosis-associated cellular labile iron and reactive oxygen species, as well as eventual ferroptotic cell death. Therefore, ferroptosis is an autophagic cell death process, and NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy supports ferroptosis by controlling cellular iron homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Background: Although the carcinogenic potential of iron has been shown, evidence from observational studies that have linked serum iron variables and cancer outcomes has been inconsistent. Objective: We investigated whether higher iron concentrations increased risk of cancer outcomes. Design: A prospective examination of iron biomarkers as independent risk factors for cancer was assessed in 1597 men and 1795 women aged 25-79 y who participated in the 1994/1995 Busselton Health Survey and had relevant data, no history of cancer before the survey, and serum ferritin concentrations {$>$}= 20 mu g/L. Follow-up for incident cancers and death from cancer was available to 2010. Proportional hazards regression modeling was performed to investigate if iron status predicted cancer incidence and mortality. Results: After adjustments for age, smoking, drinking, anthropometric and biochemical variables, or menopausal status (breast cancer), higher serum iron concentrations and transferrin saturation were associated with increased risks of incident nonskin cancer [HR for iron: 1.83 (95\% CI: 1.21, 2.76; P {$<$} 0.01); HR for transferrin saturation: 1.68 (95\% CI: 1.18, 2.38; P {$<$} 0.01)] including breast cancer [HR for iron: 2.45 (95\% CI:1.12, 5.34; P {$<$} 0.05); HR for transferrin saturation: 1.90 (95\% CI:1.02, 3.56; P {$<$} 0.05)] in women. Transferrin saturation was also associated with a greater risk of cancer death (HR: 2.48; 95\% CI: 1.28, 4.82; P {$<$} 0.01). In men, higher iron concentrations were associated with reduced risks of incident nonskin cancer (HR: 0.65; 95\% CI: 0.42, 0.99; P {$<$} 0.05) including colorectal cancer (HR: 0.34; 95\% CI: 0.12, 0.95; P {$<$} 0.05). There was no association between serum iron and colorectal cancer risk in women. Serum ferritin was not associated with cancer risk or cancer death. Conclusions: Higher transferrin saturation or serum iron concentrations were associated with increased nonskin cancer risk and increased risk of cancer death. Conversely, in men, higher serum iron concentrations were associated with decreased risk of non skin cancer. The molecular basis for the observed differences in the association between serum iron and nonskin cancer risk is unclear.},

  abstract = {Iron is an essential dietary element. However, the ability of iron to cycle between oxidized and reduced forms also renders it capable of contributing to free radical formation, which can have deleterious effects, including promutagenic effects that can potentiate tumor formation. Dysregulation of iron metabolism can increase cancer risk and promote tumor growth. Cancer cells exhibit an enhanced dependence on iron relative to their normal counterparts, a phenomenon we have termed iron addiction. Work conducted in the past few years has revealed new cellular processes and mechanisms that deepen our understanding of the link between iron and cancer. Control of iron efflux through the combined action of ferroportin, an iron efflux pump, and its regulator hepcidin appears to play an important role in tumorigenesis. Ferroptosis is a form of iron-dependent cell death involving the production of reactive oxygen species. Specific mechanisms involved in ferroptosis, including depletion of glutathione and inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4, have been uncovered. Ferritinophagy is a newly identified mechanism for degradation of the iron storage protein ferritin. Perturbations of mechanisms that control transcripts encoding proteins that regulate iron have been observed in cancer cells, including differences in miRNA, methylation, and acetylation. These new insights may ultimately provide new therapeutic opportunities for treating cancer.},

Colon-specific Dmt1 disruption resulted in a tumor-selective inhibitory effect of proliferation in mouse colon tumor models. Proteomic and genomic analyses identified an iron-regulated signaling axis mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), JAK1, and STAT3 in CRC progression. A pharmacological inhibitor of DMT1 antagonized the ability of iron to promote tumor growth in a CRC mouse model and a patient-derived CRC enteroid orthotopic model.

  abstract = {Dysregulation in iron metabolism can lead to a wide range of diseases including cancer. Iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs) and iron responsive elements (IREs) have been established as post-transcriptional regulators of intracellular iron homeostasis. The roles of other pathways involved in this process, however, remain largely unknown. Here we report that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an oncogenic driver, binds to and regulates the subcellular distribution of transferrin receptor 1(TfR1) through its tyrosine kinase activity and thus is required for cellular iron import. Inactivation of EGFR reduces the cell surface TfR1 expression, which leads to decreased iron import due to impaired TfR1-mediated iron uptake. This damaged iron assimilation results in cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition, which can be partially rescued by non-Tf-bound iron supplements. Evaluation of non-small cell lung cancer samples reveals a positive correlation between EGFR activation and membrane TfR1 expression. Our findings uncover a new role of EGFR in modulating cellular iron homeostasis through redistribution of TfR1, which is essential for cancer development and progression.

  abstract = {Protein is important to the human body, and different sources of protein may have different effects on the risk of breast cancer. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between different dietary protein sources and breast cancer risk. PubMed and several databases were searched until December 2015. Relevant articles were retrieved according to specific searching criteria. Forty-six prospective studies were included. The summary relative risk (RR) for highest versus lowest intake was 1.07 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.14, I-2 = 34.6\%) for processed meat, 0.92 (95\% CI 0.84-1.00, I-2 = 0\%) for soy food, 0.93 (95\% CI 0.85-1.00, I-2 = 40.1\%) for skim milk, and 0.90 (95\% CI 0.82-1.00, I-2 = 0\%) for yogurt. Similar conclusions were obtained in dose-response association for each serving increase: total red meat (RR: 1.07; 95\% CI 1.01-1.14, I-2 = 7.1\%), fresh red meat (RR: 1.13; 95\% CI 1.01-1.26, I-2 = 56.4\%), processed meat (RR: 1.09; 95\% CI 1.02-1.17, I-2 = 11.8\%), soy food (RR: 0.91; 95\% CI 0.84-1.00, I-2 = 0\%), and skim milk (RR: 0.96; 95\% CI 0.92-1.00, I-2 = 11.9\%). There was a null association between poultry, fish, egg, nuts, total milk, and whole milk intake and breast cancer risk. Higher total red meat, fresh red meat, and processed meat intake may be risk factors for breast cancer, whereas higher soy food and skim milk intake may reduce the risk of breast cancer.},

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 78 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed PTCL that were treated with anthracycline-containing regimens between 1998 and 2011. Results: The patients consisted of 50 males and 28 females with a median age of 64 years (range, 16-83 years). The subtypes of PTCL were 39 PTCL, not otherwise specified and 39 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). The median observation period for the surviving patients was 50 months. The overall survival (OS) was poorer in patients with serum ferritin level above the upper normal limit (n = 28), compared with patients with serum ferritin level within normal range (n = 50; 4-year OS: 23\% vs. 72\%; P {$<$} 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, poor performance status (P = 0.006) and elevated serum ferritin level (P = 0.018) were independent risk factors for poor OS. Conclusion: Serum ferritin level is a useful prognostic marker for PTCL.},

Determination of causation specifically by red or processed meat is contingent upon identification of plausible mechanisms that lead to colorectal cancer. We conducted a systematic review of the available evidence to determine the availability of plausible mechanistic data linking red and processed meat consumption to colorectal cancer risk. Forty studies using animal models or cell cultures met specified inclusion criteria, most of which were designed to examine the role of heme iron or heterocyclic amines in relation to colon carcinogenesis. Most studies used levels of meat or meat components well in excess of those found in human diets. Although many of the experiments used semi-purified diets designed to mimic the nutrient loads in current westernized diets, most did not include potential biologically active protective compounds present in whole foods. Because of these limitations in the existing literature, there is currently insufficient evidence to confirm a mechanistic link between the intake of red meat as part of a healthy dietary pattern and colorectal cancer risk.},

We investigated whether dietary calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, selenium and zinc intake were associated with LC risk. We analyzed data from 5435 participants of the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study among subjects aged 55 years and older. At baseline (1990-1993), diet was measured by a validated food frequency questionnaire. LC events were diagnosed on the basis of pathology data and medical records. Hazard ratios (HRs) on LC for energy-adjusted mineral intake were calculated using Cox regression models while adjusting for potential confounders. During a follow-up period of 22 years, we identified 211 incident cases of LC. A higher zinc intake was associated with 42 \% reduction in risk of LC (top tertile vs. first tertile: HR 0.58, 95 \% CI 0.35; 0.94, P-for trend = 0.039). Similarly, high intake of iron was associated with reduced risk of LC (top tertile vs. first tertile: HR 0.58, 95 \% CI 0.37; 0.92, P-for trend = 0.021). There was no association between dietary intake of calcium, copper, magnesium and selenium and LC risk. Our results suggest that dietary zinc and iron intake are associated with reduced risk of LC.

To date, however, the expression of iron regulatory protein-2 (IRP2), which is known to regulate several iron metabolism proteins, has not been assessed in colorectal cancer. Expression of IRP2 was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in human colorectal cancer tissue. By interrogating The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, expression of IRP2 and transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) was assessed relative to common mutations that are known to occur in cancer. The impact of suppressing IRP2 on cellular iron metabolism was also determined by using siRNA and by using the MEK inhibitor trametinib. IRP2 was overexpressed in colorectal cancer compared to normal colonic mucosa and its expression was positively correlated with TfR1 expression. In addition, IRP2 expression was associated with mutations in BRAF. The MEK inhibitor trametinib suppressed IRP2 and this was associated with a suppression in TfR1 and the labile iron pool (LIP). Moreover, epidermal growth factor stimulation resulted in decreased ferritin expression and an increase in the LIP which were independent of IRP2. Results presented here suggest that ablating IRP2 provides a therapeutic platform for intervening in colorectal tumorigenesis.},

While in short-term treatment of malaria, an excellent safety profile has been found for ART, the potential long-term treatment of cancer patients demands a phase I dose-finding clinical trial determining the daily ART dose which would be well tolerated as add-on therapy. Methods Patients with metastatic breast cancer were to receive either 100 or 150 or 200 mg oral ART daily as add-on to their guideline-based oncological therapy for a study period of four weeks with frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring until 4-8 weeks thereafter. According to the statistical design, recruitment was scheduled in groups of three patients in order not to miss a more than 33\% frequency of dose-limiting adverse events (DL-AE) prior to dose escalation. Results Twenty-three patients were recruited, and all planned dose levels were applied. During the actual trial period of 4 +/- 1 weeks, three patients experienced six DL-AEs altogether (leucopenia, neutropenia, asthenia, anemia) possibly related to ART (not exceeding 33\% in any dose level). Conclusions Up to 200 mg/d (2.2-3.9 mg/kg/d) oral ART were safe and well tolerated; therefore, 200 mg/d are recommended for phase II/III trials. Safety monitoring should include reticulocytes, NTproBNP, as well as audiological and neurological exploration.},

  abstract = {Inhibition of complex I (CI) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by BAY 87-2243 ('BAY') triggers death of BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell lines and inhibits in vivo tumor growth. Here we studied the mechanism by which this inhibition induces melanoma cell death. BAY treatment depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi), increased cellular ROS levels, stimulated lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione levels. These effects were paralleled by increased opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and stimulation of autophagosome formation and mitophagy. BAY-induced cell death was not due to glucose shortage and inhibited by the antioxidant alpha-tocopherol and the mPTP inhibitor cyclosporin A. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) overexpression in BAY-treated cells lowered ROS levels and inhibited mPTP opening and cell death, whereas the latter was potentiated by TRAP1 knockdown. Knockdown of autophagy-related 5 (ATG5) inhibited the BAY-stimulated autophagosome formation, cellular ROS increase and cell death. Knockdown of phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) inhibited the BAY-induced Delta Psi depolarization, mitophagy stimulation, ROS increase and cell death. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) knockdown induced mitochondrial filamentation and inhibited BAY-induced cell death. The latter was insensitive to the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK, but reduced by necroptosis inhibitors (necrostatin-1, necrostatin-1s)) and knockdown of key necroptosis proteins (receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)). BAY-induced cell death was also reduced by the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 and overexpression of the ferroptosis-inhibiting protein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). This overexpression also inhibited the BAY-induced ROS increase and lipid peroxidation. Conversely, GPX4 knockdown potentiated BAY-induced cell death. We propose a chain of events in which: (i) CI inhibition induces mPTP opening and Delta Psi depolarization, that (ii) stimulate autophagosome formation, mitophagy and an associated ROS increase, leading to (iii) activation of combined necroptotic/ferroptotic cell death.},

  abstract = {Ovarian cancer is a lethal malignancy that has not seen a major therapeutic advance in over 30 years. We demonstrate that ovarian cancer exhibits a targetable alteration in iron metabolism. Ferroportin (FPN), the iron efflux pump, is decreased, and transferrin receptor (TFR1), the iron importer, is increased in tumor tissue from patients with high grade but not low grade serous ovarian cancer. A similar profile of decreased FPN and increased TFR1 is observed in a genetic model of ovarian cancer tumor-initiating cells (TICs). The net result of these changes is an accumulation of excess intracellular iron and an augmented dependence on iron for proliferation. A forced reduction in intracellular iron reduces the proliferation of ovarian cancer TICs in vitro, and inhibits both tumor growth and intraperitoneal dissemination of tumor cells in vivo. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that iron increases metastatic spread by facilitating invasion through expression of matrix metalloproteases and synthesis of interleukin 6 (IL-6). We show that the iron dependence of ovarian cancer TICs renders them exquisitely sensitive in vivo to agents that induce iron-dependent cell death (ferroptosis) as well as iron chelators, and thus creates a metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited therapeutically.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Serum ferritin is the best indicator of iron stores in the body. The level of serum ferritin was found to be elevated in number of malignancies. Serum ferritin is also been established as prognostic marker for malignant lymphoma, cervical cancer, breast cancer, etc. Aims and Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the level of serum ferritin in patients with pretreatment and posttreatment of squamous cell carcinoma and to determine the significance of serum ferritin as prognostic marker for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Materials and Methods: Blood samples of 15 normal, thirty potentially malignant lesions, and thirty patients of squamous cell carcinoma were taken and analyzed for serum ferritin using ELISA. Of thirty patients, 15 patients were followed up till 6 months after their treatment and serum ferritin was again determined. Results: The average serum ferritin of 30 potentially malignant disorders was 62.70 ng/ml, and thirty patients with squamous cell carcinoma were found to be 162.47 ng/dl. After 6 months of the treatment, the mean fall in serum ferritin with nonrecurrence patients was 84 ng/dl and increase in the serum ferritin in recurrence cases was 13.4 ng/dl. Conclusion: Determining serum ferritin is a convenient and nonexpensive method to determine the outcome of the treatment of the cases with OSCC. Its potential as prognostic marker could not be overlooked.},

Sigma 1 receptor (SIR) has been suggested to function in oxidative stress metabolism. Both erastin and sorafenib significantly induced S1R protein expression. Haloperidol strongly promoted erastin- and sorafenib-induced cell death, which was blocked by ferrostatin-1 but not ZVAD-FMK or necrosulfonamide. During ferroptosis, haloperidol substantially increased the cellular levels of Fe2+, GSH and lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, several ferroptosis-related protein targets were up-regulated in the absence of haloperidol. Thus, Our study identified an association between haloperidol and ferroptosis for the first time.

  abstract = {Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death characterized by the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides to lethal levels. Emerging evidence suggests that ferroptosis represents an ancient vulnerability caused by the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into cellular membranes, and cells have developed complex systems that exploit and defend against this vulnerability in different contexts. The sensitivity to ferroptosis is tightly linked to numerous biological processes, including amino acid, iron, and polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism, and the biosynthesis of glutathione, phospholipids, NADPH, and coenzyme Q(10). Ferroptosis has been implicated in the pathological cell death associated with degenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases), carcinogenesis, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and kidney degeneration in mammals and is also implicated in heat stress in plants. Ferroptosis may also have a tumor-suppressor function that could be harnessed for cancer therapy. This Primer reviews the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, highlights connections to other areas of biology and medicine, and recommends tools and guidelines for studying this emerging form of regulated cell death.},

Our previous work demonstrated that iron homeostasis is altered in prostate cancer and contributes to prostate cancer progression. Here we report that prostate cancer cells overexpress IRP2 and that overexpression of IRP2 drives the altered iron phenotype of prostate cancer cells. IRP2 knockdown in prostate cancer cell lines reduces intracellular iron and causes cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis demonstrates that IRP2-depleted prostate cancer cells accumulate in G0/G1 due to induction of p15, p21, and p27. Activation of these pathways is sufficient to significantly reduce the growth of PC3 prostate tumors in vivo. In contrast, IRP1 knockdown does not affect iron homeostasis and only modestly affects cell growth, likely through an iron-independent mechanism. These results demonstrate that upregulation of IRP2 in prostate cancer cells co-opts normal iron regulatory mechanisms to facilitate iron retention and drive enhanced tumor growth.},

  abstract = {Aims: Ferroportin (FPN) is an iron exporter that plays an important role in cellular and systemic iron metabolism. Our previous work has demonstrated that FPN is decreased in prostate tumors. We sought to identify the molecular pathways regulated by FPN in prostate cancer cells. Results: We show that overexpression of FPN induces profound effects in cells representative of multiple histological subtypes of prostate cancer by activating different but converging pathways. Induction of FPN induces autophagy and activates the transcription factors tumor protein 53 (p53) and Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) and their common downstream target, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21). FPN also induces cell cycle arrest and stress-induced DNA-damage genes. Effects of FPN are attributable to its effects on intracellular iron and can be reproduced with iron chelators. Importantly, expression of FPN not only inhibits proliferation of all prostate cancer cells studied but also reduces growth of tumors derived from castrate-resistant adenocarcinoma C4-2 cells in vivo. Innovation: We use a novel model of FPN expression to interrogate molecular pathways triggered by iron depletion in prostate cancer cells. Since prostate cancer encompasses different subtypes with a highly variable clinical course, we further explore how histopathological subtype influences the response to iron depletion. We demonstrate that prostate cancer cells that derive from different histopathological subtypes activate converging pathways in response to FPN-mediated iron depletion. Activation of these pathways is sufficient to significantly reduce the growth of treatment-refractory C4-2 prostate tumors in vivo. Conclusions: Our results may explain why FPN is dramatically suppressed in cancer cells, and they suggest that FPN agonists may be beneficial in the treatment of prostate cancer.}

We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association of lung cancer, among never smokers, with consumption of various type of meat, fish, heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We performed a systematic literature search and meta-analysis, for highest versus lowest consumption and dose-response. The results from random effects models summarized data from 14 independent observational studies and 5368 lung cancer cases. We found a statistically significant 24\% increased risk of lung cancer for high consumption of red meat (Summary Relative Risk 1.24, 95\% CI 1.01-1.51), based on 11 estimates, with low heterogeneity (I-2 = 31\%) and no indication of publication bias. No significant associations between high consumption of other types of meat, fish nor for heterocyclic amines and lung cancer risk were detected. No significant risk estimates were found for the increase of one serving per week of any type of meat or fish. Our meta-analysis suggests that a high intake of red meat may increases the risk of lung cancer among never and non-smokers.},

  abstract = {Iron is essential for the growth of all cells, including tumor cells. The authors previously reported that a variety of transplantable tumors grew faster and larger in mice that were on an iron-rich diet compared with those on an iron-deficient diet. In this study the authors examined the relationship between iron in the diet and development of tumors in mice that are known to develop spontaneous tumors-C3H/HeN-MTV+(C3H-MTV+) mice that were congenitally infected with mammary tumor virus. These mice have a greater than 96\% chance of developing mammary tumors between the ages of 7.2 and 9.2 months. Fifteen C3H-MTV+ weanlings were given a low-iron diet (5 mg iron/kg diet), and 15 were given diets with normal amounts of iron (180 mg Fe/kg diet). Thirteen of the 15 mice from the low-iron group and all 15 mice from the normal-iron group developed tumors. The average tumor growth rate in the normal-iron group was 112\%/wk, compared with 62\%/wk for the low-iron group. The difference in tumor growth rate between the two groups was significant (P = 0.02 by Student's t test). In this study, low iron intake did not prevent tumor development, but the results confirm the authors' previous report that iron nutrition of the host affects tumor growth; tumors grow better in an iron-rich environment. High levels of iron in the diet may enhance tumor growth, and this should be considered when treating patients with cancer.},

It is composed of two dissimilar subunits, R1, the large subunit containing the allosteric regulatory sites, and R2, the small subunit containing a binuclear iron center and a tyrosyl free radical. Recent isolation of the mammalian and yeast RNR genes has shown that, in addition to the well documented allosteric regulation, the synthesis of the enzyme is also tightly regulated at the level of transcription. The mRNAs for both subunits are cell-cycle regulated and, in yeast, inducible by DNA damage. Yeast encode a second large subunit gene, RNR3, that is expressed only in the presence of DNA damage. This regulation is thought to provide a metabolic state that facilitates DNA replicational repair processes.},

  abstract = {Ferritin is the major intracellular iron-storage protein in eucaryotic cells and plays a prominent role in maintaining intracellular iron homeostasis. We observed that transfection of NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts with the adenovirus E1A oncogene specifically repressed the mRNA for one of the subunits of ferritin, ferritin H. This occurred in the absence of any effect of E1A on the mRNA for the L subunit of ferritin. The repression of ferritin H was not a general feature of oncogene expression since transfection of NIH-3T3 cells with H-ras did not affect ferritin composition. Deletion of the conserved regions of E1A responsible for immortalization and transcriptional repression impaired the ability of E1A to repress ferritin H. Immunoprecipitation of ferritin in E1A transfectants demonstrated that the decrease in the ferritin H/L ratio observed at the mRNA level was also exhibited at the protein level. The E1A-dependent inhibition of ferritin H was also observed in a chimeric gene containing the ferritin H promoter ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, but was not observed in control genes in which chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was dependent on promoters derived from SV40 or the interleukin-3 gene. This suggests that E1A may repress ferritin H at the transcriptional level. These results demonstrate that the adenovirus E1A oncogene specifically modulates ferritin H expression. They also suggest that alterations in cellular iron metabolism may be among the diverse array of cellular responses induced by E1A.},

  abstract = {In view of the high relapse rate following chemotherapy for patients with advanced neuroblastoma (NB) and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), we designed a novel chemotherapy program which incorporated the iron chelator deferoxamine. The purpose of the deferoxamine was to sensitize the cells to standard chemotherapy. The D-CECaT regimen contained (in mg/m2): deferoxamine 4500 during days 1-5; cyclophosphamide 600 mg over days 6 and 7; etoposide 300 mg over days 7 and 8; carboplatin 100 mg over days 7 and 8; and thiotepa 30 mg over days 6-8. Between October 1989 and May 1992 we entered 23 advanced NB and two PNET patients. Sepsis occurred in four courses, nausea and vomiting in 30 courses, and 50 courses required blood and platelets. Responses observed in previously untreated patients with stage III NB: six out of six CR (17 + to 41 + months), with stage IV NB, nine out of 11 CR (1 4 + to 28 + months), two out of 11 VGPR (22 + months), with stage IV PNET two out of two CR (1 + to 35 + months). With previously treated and failed stage IV NG, two out of six VGPR for 19 + and 20 months, and four out of six PR 1, 8, 9 and 11 months. Median survival for 19 new patients was 22 + months (6 to 41 + months; two patients in CR died at 7 months during adjuvant autologous marrow transplant). In conclusion, D-CECaT is an effective initial cytoreductive regimen for advanced stage NB/PNET patients. Additional patients and studies are required to determine its use as an alternative to autologous bone marrow transplantation.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to address the hypothesis that elevated body iron increases the risk of cancer occurrence and death, and to determine the dose response. Subjects were 3,287 men and 5,269 women participating in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who had a transferrin saturation determination at enrollment (1971-1975), who remained alive and cancer-free for at least 4 years, and who were followed to 1988 for cancer outcome. Among 379 men who developed cancer over the study period, the mean transferrin saturation at enrollment was 32.1\% whereas among 2,908 who remained cancer-free it was 30.7\%; the difference for mortality was 32.3\% among 233 deaths vs. 30.8\% among 3,054 men not dying of cancer. The mean differences among women were not significant. The mean differences in TIBC and serum iron among men were consistent with the findings for transferrin saturation, and all 3 differences were stable over time when examined by years since blood test. Men and women were divided into 5 groups on the basis of baseline transferrin saturation: 0 to 30\%, 30-40\%, 40-50\%, 50-60\%, and 60\% and higher. Nineteen percent of men had a baseline transferrin saturation above 40\% (the last 3 groups), whereas only 10 percent of women had transferrin saturation above 40\%. For men and women combined, risk of cancer occurrence in each group relative to the first was 1.0, 0.95, 1.16, 1.38 and 1.81; for mortality the relative risks were 1.0, 0.96, 1.22, 1.29 and 1.73. There is evidence, in this cohort, of elevated cancer risk in those with moderately elevated iron level. This pattern was seen in women as well as in men. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We have investigated the levels of typical hydroxyl radical-induced DNA base modifications in renal chromatin of male Wistar rats treated with a single or repeated administrations of Fe-NTA. Five pyrimidine-derived and 5 purine-derived modified DNA bases were identified and quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with selected-ion monitoring. The modified bases were 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin, 5-(hydroxymethyl)uracil, 5-hydroxycytosine, thymine glycol, 5,6-dihydroxyuracil, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine, 8-hydroxyadenine, xanthine, 2-hydroxyadenine and 8-hydroxyguanine. The amounts of most of these compounds were significantly increased over control levels in renal chromatin of Fe-NTA-treated rats as measured 3 and 24 hr after treatment. Elevated levels of modified bases were accompanied by proximal tubular necrosis. On the 19th day, however, accumulation of modified DNA bases was not observed. Morphologically, scattered karyomegalic cells were seen in the proximal tubules, but necrosis was rarely found. Some of the identified DNA base lesions are known to be promutagenic, although others have not been investigated. Presence of modified DNA bases concomitant with necrosis and regeneration of the renal proximal tubules may be a critical step in Fe-NTA-induced carcinogenesis. (C) 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Here we have  tested the ability of ferrous iron to induce \{[\}H-3]dopamine association  to cytoplasmic proteins and we have established that a similar oxidation  mechanism evidenced iii vitro a studies could be applied in cell  culture. When PC12 cells were incubated with Ferrous iron (ferrocene).  the binding of \{[\}H-3]dopamine to proteins was found to be two fold  increased with respect to control. The iron is likely to accelerate the  oxidation of dopamine to produce quinones which covalently bind to  proteins and induce high-molecular protein aggregates. We evidenced that  dopamine/from combination induced cell death in undifferentiated PC12  cells via an active cellular process evaluated in terms of morphological  and biochemical changes indicative of apoptosis. We also demonstrated  induction of lipid peroxidation when dopamine and ferrocene were present  in high concentrations. Moreover, ascorbic acid diminished apoptosis but  not the lipid peroxidation process. It might indicate that ferrocene and  dopamine could produce oxidative stress of a different nature. These  results show that the actions of dopamine and iron are essential in the  induction of apoptosis and lipid peroxidation. However. there is no  necessary causual link between lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. Our  data also suggest that iron is capable of increasing the cytotoxicity of  dopamine merely by increasing its rate of oxidation and without  intervention of the monoamine oxidase B enzyme and, hence, both  phenomenons may occur independently from each other ill rat  pheochromocytoma PC12. These observations may have relevance to the  understanding of the mechanism by which dopaminergic neurones are  destroyed in some neurodegenerative disorders.\}},

  abstract = {Deriving statistical models to predict one variable from one or more other variables, or predictive modeling, is an important activity in obesity and nutrition research. To determine the quality of the model, it is necessary to quantify and report the predictive validity of the derived models. Conducting validation of the predictive measures provides essential information to the research community about the model. Unfortunately, many articles fail to account for the nearly inevitable reduction in predictive ability that occurs when a model derived on one dataset is applied to a new dataset. Under some circumstances, the predictive validity can be reduced to nearly zero. In this overview, we explain why reductions in predictive validity occur, define the metrics commonly used to estimate the predictive validity of a model (e.g., R2, mean squared error, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic, concordance index), and describe methods to estimate the predictive validity (e.g., cross-validation, bootstrap, adjusted and shrunken R2). We emphasize that methods for estimating the expected reduction in predictive ability of a model in new samples are available and this expected reduction should always be reported when new predictive models are introduced.},

  abstract = {Background: Since targeting oxidative stress markers has been recently recognized as a novel therapeutic target in cancer, it is interesting to investigate whether genetic susceptibility may modify oxidative stress response in cancer. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether genetic polymorphism in the antioxidant enzymes is associated with lipid peroxidation in breast cancer. Methods: We conducted a study among Polish women, including 136 breast cancer cases and 183 healthy controls. The analysis included genetic polymorphisms in five redox related genes: GPX1 (rs1050450), GPX4 (rs713041), SOD2 (rs4880), SEPP1 (rs3877899) and SEP15 (rs5859), lipid peroxidation, the activities of antioxidant enzymes determined in blood compartments as well as plasma concentration of selenium - an antioxidant trace element involved in cancer. Genotyping was performed using the Real Time PCR. Lipid peroxidation was expressed as plasma concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and measured with the spectrofluorometric method. Glutathione peroxidase activity was spectrophotometrically determined in erythrocytes (GPx1) and plasma (GPx3) by the use of Paglia and Valentine method. Spectrophotometric methods were employed to measure activity of cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in erythrocytes (Beauchamp and Fridovich method) and ceruloplasmin (Cp) in plasma (Sunderman and Nomoto method). Plasma selenium concentration was determined using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results: Breast cancer risk was significantly associated with GPX1 rs1050450 (Pro198Leu) polymorphism, showing a protective effect of variant (Leu) allele. As compared to the control subjects, lipid peroxidation and GPx1 activity were significantly higher in the breast cancer cases, whereas ceruloplasmin activity was decreased. After genotype stratification, both GPx1 activity and TBARS concentration were the highest in GPX1 Pro/Pro homozygotes affected by breast cancer. At the same time, there was a significant correlation between the level of lipid peroxidation and GPx1 activity among the cancer subjects possessing GPX1 Pro/Pro genotype (r = 0.3043; p = 0.0089), whereas such a correlation was completely absent in the cases carrying at least one GPX1 Leu allele as well as in the controls (regardless of GPX1 genotype). Conclusions: GPX1 polymorphism may be an important factor modifying oxidative stress response in breast cancer subjects. Further studies are needed to elucidate its potential clinical significance.},

  abstract = {Iron deficiency (ID) is the most prevalent nutrient deficiency within the developed world. This is of concern as ID has been shown to affect immunity, thermoregulation, work performance and cognition. Animal flesh foods provide the richest and most bioavailable source of dietary (haem) iron, however, it is unclear whether low animal flesh diets contribute to ID. This systematic review aimed to investigate whether a higher consumption of animal flesh foods is associated with better iron status in adults. CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE and MEDLINE were searched for published studies that included adults (≥18 years) from developed countries and measured flesh intakes in relation to iron status indices. Eight experimental and 41 observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Generally, studies varied in population and study designs and results were conflicting. Of the seven high quality studies, five showed a positive association between animal flesh intake (85–300 g/day) and iron status. However, the optimum quantity or frequency of flesh intake required to maintain or achieve a healthy iron status remains unclear. Results show a promising relationship between animal flesh intake and iron status, however, additional longitudinal and experimental studies are required to confirm this relationship and determine optimal intakes to reduce ID development.},

  abstract = {Iron deficiency anaemia is a major health problem affecting approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide. Young children, women of reproductive age and pregnant women living in sub-Saharan Africa are the most vulnerable. It is estimated that iron deficiency accounts for half of anaemia cases. Apart from nutritional deficiency, infection, inflammation and genetic factors are the major drivers of anaemia. However, the role of genetic risk factors has not been thoroughly investigated. This is particularly relevant in African populations, as they carry high genetic diversity and have a high prevalence of anaemia. Multiple genetic variations in iron regulatory genes have been linked to impaired iron status. Here we conducted a literature review to identify genetic variants associated with iron imbalance among global populations. We compare their allele frequencies and risk scores and we investigated population-specific selection among populations of varying geographic origin using data from the Keneba Biobank representing individuals in rural Gambia and the 1000 Genomes Project. We identified a significant lack of data on the genetic determinants of iron status in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the studies on genetic determinants of iron status have been conducted in Europeans. Also, we identified population differences in allele frequencies in candidate putative genetic risk factors. Given the disproportionately high genetic diversity in African populations coupled with their high prevalence of iron deficiency, there is need to investigate the genetic influences of low iron status in Sub-Saharan Africa. The resulting insights may inform the future implementation of iron intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {Objectives Measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] is generally considered to be a reliable indicator of vitamin D status. The recent increase in diversity of 25(OH)D assays prompted us to evaluate the performance of chromatographic methods (two in-house ID–LC–MS/MS and HPLC (ClinRep, Recipe)), a protein binding method (Cobas-25(OH)D-total, Roche) and immunochemical methods (Liaison and RIA (Diasorin), iSYS (IDS), ADVIA Centaur (Siemens), and Architect i1000 and i2000 (Abbott)). Methods Blood was drawn from randomly selected outpatients (N=60) at one site after informed consent. DEQAS and SRM 972 samples were obtained from the scheme organizer and NIST, respectively. Serum aliquots were prepared, frozen and transported to participating centers. Method comparison was performed according to CLSI-EP9 specifications. Results With these patient samples, and in comparison with ID–LC–MS/MS, Deming regression parameters slope, intercept and R were found to be within the ranges [0.57–1.07], [−1.7 to 6.9nmol/L] and [0.88–0.98], respectively. 25(OH)D2 in DEQAS and SRM samples was fully recognized by chromatographic methods, but only partially by protein binding and immunochemical methods. Chromatographic methods, and to a lesser extent the protein binding assay, showed cross-reactivity with 3-epi-25(OH)D3. Agreement of 25(OH)D assays to ID–LC–MS/MS in sorting patients into distinct 25(OH)D categories varied between 53\% and 88\%. Conclusions Significant bias exists between ID–LC–MS/MS and many, but not all, other 25(OH)D assays. The variable response among different assays for 25(OH)D metabolites impedes the use of uniform cut-off values for defining vitamin D status. Our results indicate the need towards further standardizing assays for 25(OH)D measurement.},

In the present study, we have tested a hypothesis that, in addition to estrogen, both iron deficiency due to menstruation and iron accumulation as a result of menstrual stop play important roles in menopause-related BC outcomes. We first tested this hypothesis in cell culture models mimicking the high estrogen and low iron premenopausal condition and the low estrogen and high iron postmenopausal condition, respectively. Subsequently, we examined this hypothesis in mice that were fed iron deficient and iron overload diets. We have shown that estrogen only slightly up-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenic factor known to be important in BC recurrence. It is, rather, iron deficiency that significantly promotes VEGF by stabilizing hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Conversely, high iron levels increase oxidative stress and sustain mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, which are mechanisms of known significance in BC development. Taken together, our results suggest, for the first time, that an iron deficiency-mediated pro-angiogenic environment could contribute to the high recurrence of BC in young patients, and iron accumulation-associated pro-oxidant conditions could lead to the high incidence of BC in older women.},

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

In a case-cohort study, main exposure variables are measured only on some selected subjects, but other covariates are often available for the whole cohort. We consider this as a special case of a missing covariate by design. We propose to employ a popular incomplete data method, multiple imputation, for estimation of the regression parameters in additive hazards models. For imputation models, an imputation modeling procedure based on a rejection sampling is developed. A simple imputation modeling that can naturally be applied to a general missing-at-random situation is also considered and compared with the rejection sampling method via extensive simulation studies. In addition, a misspecification aspect in imputation modeling is investigated. The proposed procedures are illustrated using a cancer data example. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Free iron is a pro-oxidant and can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage. The carcinogenicity of iron has been demonstrated in animal models, and epidemiologic studies have shown associations with several human cancers. However, a possible role of excess body iron stores or of elevated iron intake in breast carcinogenesis has received little attention epidemiologically. We propose that iron overload and the disruption of iron homeostasis with a resulting increase in free iron may contribute to the development of breast cancer, and we summarize the relevant evidence from mechanistic studies, animal experiments, and studies in humans. Over time a high intake of iron can lead to iron overload. Furthermore, body iron stores increase in women following menopause. Reactive oxygen species produced by normal aerobic cellular metabolism can lead to the release of free iron from ferritin. In the presence of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, stored ferric iron (Fe3+) is reduced to ferrous iron (Fe2+), which catalyzes the formation of the hydroxyl radical (*OH). *OH in turn can promote lipid peroxidation, mutagenesis, DNA strand breaks, oncogene activation, and tumor suppressor inhibition, increasing the risk of breast cancer. In addition to its independent role as a proxidant, high levels of free iron may potentiate the effects of estradiol, ethanol, and ionizing radiation-three established risk factors for breast cancer. In order to identify the role of iron in breast carcinogenesis, improved biomarkers of body iron stores are needed, as are cohort studies which assess heme iron intake. Ultimately, it is important to determine whether iron levels in the breast and iron-induced pathology are higher in women who go on to develop breast cancer compared to women who do not.},

In this paper, we focus on this, and present an approach to estimation for certain ‘difficult’ situations associated with retrospective or incomplete prospective observation. The paper begins with the identification of some problem areas in the analysis of data on life history processes. We discuss maximum likelihood estimation in some simple contexts and introduce a pseudo-likelihood which enables the simple analysis of some sampling procedures. This approach is illustrated on standard retrospective and case-cohort designs.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the effects of long-term tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibition on the risk and age at onset of Parkinson disease (PD), we performed a 2-sample Mendelian randomization study using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. Methods Genetic variants in the vicinity of TNFRSF1A, the gene encoding TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), were identified as predictive of pharmacologic blockade of TNFR1 signaling by anti-TNF therapy, based on genetic associations with lower circulating C-reactive protein (CRP; GWAS n = 204,402). The effects of TNF-TNFR1 inhibition were estimated for PD risk (ncases/controls = 37,688/981,372) and age at PD onset (n = 28,568) using GWAS data from the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium and 23andMe, Inc. To validate variants as proxies of long-term anti-TNF treatment, we also assessed whether variant associations reflected anticipated effects of TNFR1 inhibition on Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and multiple sclerosis risk (n = 38,589-45,975). Results TNF-TNFR1 signaling inhibition was not estimated to affect PD risk (odds ratio [OR] per 10\% lower circulating CRP = 0.99; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.91–1.08) or age at onset (0.13 years later onset; 95\% CI −0.66 to 0.92). In contrast, genetically indexed TNF-TNFR1 signaling blockade predicted reduced risk of Crohn disease (OR 0.75; 95\% CI 0.65–0.86) and ulcerative colitis (OR 0.84; 95\% CI 0.74–0.97) and increased multiple sclerosis risk (OR 1.57; 95\% CI 1.36–1.81). Findings were consistent across models using different genetic instruments and Mendelian randomization estimators. Conclusions Our findings do not imply that TNF-TNFR1 signaling inhibition will prevent or delay PD onset. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class II evidence that TNF-TNFR1 signaling inhibition is not associated with the risk or age at onset of PD.},

  abstract = {Iron is a constituent of many metalloproteins involved in vital metabolic functions. While adequate iron supply is critical for health, accumulation of excess iron promotes oxidative stress and causes tissue injury and disease. Therefore, iron homeostasis needs to be tightly controlled. Mammals have developed elegant homeostatic mechanisms at the cellular and systemic level, which serve to satisfy metabolic needs for iron and to minimize the risks posed by iron's toxicity. Cellular iron metabolism is post-transcriptionally controlled by iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, while systemic iron balance is regulated by the iron hormone hepcidin. This review summarizes basic principles of mammalian iron homeostasis at the cellular and systemic level. Particular attention is given on pathways for hepcidin regulation and on crosstalk between cellular and systemic homeostatic mechanisms.},

We examined the association between regular NSAID use and breast cancer risk using a large cohort of women selected for breast cancer family history, including 1054 BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. Methods We analyzed a prospective cohort (N~=\,5606) and a larger combined, retrospective and prospective, cohort (N~=\,8233) of women who were aged 18 to 79\,years, enrolled before June 30, 2011, with follow-up questionnaire data on medication history. The prospective cohort was further restricted to women without breast cancer when medication history was asked by questionnaire. Women were recruited from seven study centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Associations were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for demographics, lifestyle factors, family history, and other medication use. Women were classified as regular or non-regular users of aspirin, COX-2 inhibitors, ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, and acetaminophen (control) based on self-report at follow-up of ever using the medication for at least twice a week for ≥1\,month prior to breast cancer diagnosis. The main outcome was incident invasive breast cancer, based on self- or relative-report (81\% confirmed pathologically). Results From fully adjusted analyses, regular aspirin use was associated with a 39\% and 37\% reduced risk of breast cancer in the prospective (HR\,=\,0.61; 95\% CI\,=\,0.33–1.14) and combined cohorts (HR\,=\,0.63; 95\% CI\,=\,0.57–0.71), respectively. Regular use of COX-2 inhibitors was associated with a 61\% and 71\% reduced risk of breast cancer (prospective HR\,=\,0.39; 95\% CI\,=\,0.15–0.97; combined HR\,=\,0.29; 95\% CI\,=\,0.23–0.38). Other NSAIDs and acetaminophen were not associated with breast cancer risk in either cohort. Associations were not modified by familial risk, and consistent patterns were found by BRCA1 and BRCA2 carrier status, estrogen receptor status, and attained age. Conclusion Regular use of aspirin and COX-2 inhibitors might reduce breast cancer risk for women at familial or genetic risk.

Serum ferritin is also a well known inflammatory marker, but it is unclear whether serum ferritin reflects or causes inflammation, or whether it is involved in an inflammatory cycle. We argue here that serum ferritin arises from damaged cells, and is thus a marker of cellular damage. The protein in serum ferritin is considered benign, but it has lost (               i.e.               dumped) most of its normal complement of iron which when unliganded is highly toxic. The facts that serum ferritin levels can correlate with both disease and with body iron stores are thus expected on simple chemical kinetic grounds. Serum ferritin levels also correlate with other phenotypic readouts such as erythrocyte morphology. Overall, this systems approach serves to explain a number of apparent paradoxes of serum ferritin, including (i) why it correlates with biomarkers of cell damage, (ii) why it correlates with biomarkers of hydroxyl radical formation (and oxidative stress) and (iii) therefore why it correlates with the presence and/or severity of numerous diseases. This leads to suggestions for how one might exploit the corollaries of the recognition that serum ferritin levels mainly represent a consequence of cell stress and damage.},

Unavailability of iron in soluble ferrous form led to development of specific pathways and machinery in different organisms to make it available for use and maintain its homeostasis. Iron homeostasis is essential as under different circumstances iron in excess as well as deprivation leads to different pathological conditions in human. Objective This review highlights the current findings related to iron excess as well as deprivation with regards to cellular proliferation. Conclusions Iron excess is extensively associated with different types of cancers viz. colorectal cancer, breast cancer etc. by producing an oxidative stressed condition and alteration of immune system. Ironically its deprivation also results in anaemic conditions and leads to cell cycle arrest at different phases with mechanism yet to be explored. Iron deprivation arrests cell cycle at G1/S and in some cases at G2/M checkpoints resulting in growth arrest. However, in some cases iron overload arrests cell cycle at G1 phase by blocking certain signalling pathways. Certain natural and synthetic iron chelators are being explored from few decades to combat diseases caused by alteration in iron homeostasis.},

Since levels of trace elements have been shown to vary in certain diseases, in the presented work, chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) levels of toenail and serum samples of healthy individuals and patients with onychocryptosis and onychomycosis were compared. Methods Serum and toenail samples of 88 voluntary subjects (healthy n = 24; onychomycosis n = 24; onychocryptosis n = 40) aged between 19–80 years were collected. Levels of trace elements in the samples were analyzed by using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrophotometer (ICP-OES Thermo iCAP - 6000). The differences in medians between the groups for elements were evaluated with Kruskal -Wallis H test with post hoc for pairwise comparisons in SPSS 18. Results Mg (p {$<$} 0.001) and Mn (p = 0.002) levels were significantly increased whereas Zn (p = 0.011) level was decreased in toenails of patients with onychomycosis compared to healthy subjects. Although Mg and Mn levels were higher in female subjects with onychomycosis (p = 0.001; p = 0.019), Mn was only increased in male subjects (p = 0.015). Mg was the only trace element found to be independent of sex, age, and smoking status in patients with onychomycosis. However, no significant difference has been found in serum trace element levels neither between any groups nor toenail trace element levels of patients with onychocryptosis and healthy subjects. Conclusion As a response of the human body to pathogens like fungi in toenails, Mg, Mn and Zn levels vary. Especially the role of Mg ions in onychomycosis needs to be investigated more specifically.},

  abstract = {Background Onychocryptosis (ingrown toenail) and onychomycosis are common pathologies of the toenail and affecting many people. Since levels of trace elements have been shown to vary in certain diseases, in the presented work, chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) levels of toenail and serum samples of healthy individuals and patients with onychocryptosis and onychomycosis were compared. Methods Serum and toenail samples of 88 voluntary subjects (healthy n = 24; onychomycosis n = 24; onychocryptosis n = 40) aged between 19–80 years were collected. Levels of trace elements in the samples were analyzed by using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrophotometer (ICP-OES Thermo iCAP - 6000). The differences in medians between the groups for elements were evaluated with Kruskal -Wallis H test with post hoc for pairwise comparisons in SPSS 18. Results Mg (p {$<$} 0.001) and Mn (p = 0.002) levels were significantly increased whereas Zn (p = 0.011) level was decreased in toenails of patients with onychomycosis compared to healthy subjects. Although Mg and Mn levels were higher in female subjects with onychomycosis (p = 0.001; p = 0.019), Mn was only increased in male subjects (p = 0.015). Mg was the only trace element found to be independent of sex, age, and smoking status in patients with onychomycosis. However, no significant difference has been found in serum trace element levels neither between any groups nor toenail trace element levels of patients with onychocryptosis and healthy subjects. Conclusion As a response of the human body to pathogens like fungi in toenails, Mg, Mn and Zn levels vary. Especially the role of Mg ions in onychomycosis needs to be investigated more specifically.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that iron overload, which indicates the accumulation of iron, generates cellular reactive oxygens and causes peroxide damages to the body. Such oxidative stresses, in a broader context, are also caused by lifestyles such as alcohol consumption and smoking. However, there are limited data on the association between these lifestyle factors and internal iron overload. In present study, we evaluated associations between lifestyle factors, such as smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity, and serum markers of iron overload. In a population-based cross-sectional study including 2,347 Korean men and women aged 49-79 years, we assessed serum transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels and defined iron overload as TSAT levels {$>$} 50\% for men and {$>$} 45\% for women. After excluding persons with chronic diseases and iron deficiency, multivariate odds ratio (OR) and its 95\% confidence interval (CI) were estimated to evaluate associations between lifestyle factors and iron overload in 1,973 participants. In all participants, we examined a significantly positive association between heavy alcohol consumption ({$>$} 30 g/day) and iron overload; heavy drinkers showed 1.6-fold higher OR (95\% CI, 1.11-2.36) than non-drinkers. Stratified analysis by sex showed that this association was significant only among men. In addition, we observed a potential association between heavy smoking {$>$} 10 cigarettes/day and iron overload (p = 0.07). In stratified analysis by sex, we examined a significant association between smoking and iron overload only among women; former or current smokers had 1.9-fold higher OR (95\% CI, 1.01-3.63) than never-smoker. Our findings suggest that heavy alcohol consumption and smoking may worsen iron accumulation in the body.},

  abstract = {Objectives: No longitudinal studies have examined how iron measures change over menopause. Our objectives were to examine iron measures in individual women at premenopause and at postmenopause and, secondarily, to determine if any changes contributed to insulin resistance. Methods: In a subset of participants (n = 70) in a longitudinal study of menopause, we measured ferritin, transferrin, and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) once in the premenopause and once in the postmenopause. We also examined associations between menopausal status and change in iron markers after adjustment for age at menopause, race/ethnicity, and waist circumference. In linear regression models, we examined associations between premenopause iron measures and changes in iron markers over menopause with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) changes over menopause, before and after adjustment for age at menopause, race/ethnicity, changes in waist circumference, C-reactive protein (CRP), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Results: Women had lower ferritin (p {$<$} 0.01), higher sTfR: ferritin levels (p {$<$} 0.01), lowerHOMA-IR (p = 0.022), and lower glucose (p = 0.05) in premenopause compared to postmenopause. After adjustment, lower premenopausal iron levels (sTfR: ferritin levels beta = 11.0, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.017-22.0) and larger increases in iron over menopause (changes in sTfR: ferritin beta = 13.6, 95\% CI 0.93-26.3) were associated with larger increases in HOMA-IR. Conclusions: From premenopause to postmenopause, women on average have increases in measures of iron stores. Women who had the greatest changes in iron over menopause (lower measures of premenopausal iron and greater increases in iron measures over the menopause) had the strongest associations between changes in iron and changes in insulin resistance.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine differences between two factor analytical methods and their relevance for symptom cluster research: common factor analysis (CFA) versus principal component analysis (PCA). Methods Literature was critically reviewed to elucidate the differences between CFA and PCA. A secondary analysis (N = 84) was utilized to show the actual result differences from the two methods. Results CFA analyzes only the reliable common variance of data, while PCA analyzes all the variance of data. An underlying hypothetical process or construct is involved in CFA but not in PCA. PCA tends to increase factor loadings especially in a study with a small number of variables and/or low estimated communality. Thus, PCA is not appropriate for examining the structure of data. Conclusion If the study purpose is to explain correlations among variables and to examine the structure of the data (this is usual for most cases in symptom cluster research), CFA provides a more accurate result. If the purpose of a study is to summarize data with a smaller number of variables, PCA is the choice. PCA can also be used as an initial step in CFA because it provides information regarding the maximum number and nature of factors. In using factor analysis for symptom cluster research, several issues need to be considered, including subjectivity of solution, sample size, symptom selection, and level of measure.

  abstract = {The case–cohort study design has often been used in studies of a rare disease or for a common disease with some biospecimens needing to be preserved for future studies. A case–cohort study design consists of a random sample, called the subcohort, and all or a portion of the subjects with the disease of interest. One advantage of the case–cohort design is that the same subcohort can be used for studying multiple diseases. Stratified random sampling is often used for the subcohort. Additive hazards models are often preferred in studies where the risk difference, instead of relative risk, is of main interest. Existing methods do not use the available covariate information fully. We propose a more efficient estimator by making full use of available covariate information for the additive hazards model with data from a stratified case–cohort design with rare (the traditional situation) and non-rare (the generalized situation) diseases. We propose an estimating equation approach with a new weight function. The proposed estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Simulation studies show that the proposed method using all available information leads to efficiency gain and stratification of the subcohort improves efficiency when the strata are highly correlated with the covariates. Our proposed method is applied to data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to inhibit several pathways in experimental models of breast carcinogenesis, but epidemiological evidence remains insufficient to support their use for breast cancer prevention. We examined the association between use of NSAIDs and breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort. Methods The Sister Study is a prospective cohort study of women who had a sister(s) with breast cancer. As of December 2013, 2118 incident breast cancers were ascertained from 50,884 women enrolled between 2003 and 2009. Lifetime history of NSAID use was estimated from self-reported data in pill-years, with 1 pill per week for a year equivalent to 1 pill-year. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of breast cancer in relation to pill-years of use for different NSAIDs, with adjustment for potential confounders. Results In the full cohort, although there was some evidence that use of non-aspirin, non-COXib NSAIDs was associated with lower breast cancer risk, there was little evidence of overall association for most categories of NSAID use. Among postmenopausal women NSAID use was not associated with reduced risk of breast cancer. However, among premenopausal women there was significantly reduced risk for any NSAID (HR4vs1\,=\,0.66, 95~\% CI: 0.50–0.87) and specifically for aspirin (HR4vs1\,=\,0.57, 95~\% CI: 0.33–0.98), with small, but non-significant reductions in risk for other drug classes. Conclusion Women with a sister with breast cancer are themselves at increased risk and might benefit the most from chemoprevention. Although there was little evidence of protective effect from NSAIDs in the overall cohort of women or among the subset who are postmenopausal, there is intriguing evidence that NSAID use, particularly aspirin, may reduce risk among premenopausal women.

The literature has not reconciled conflicting conclusions about the standard methods. Moreover, a comparison including newly developed methods, such as inverse probability weighting methods, is needed. Two analytical methods for nested case-control studies and six methods for case-cohort studies using proportional hazards regression model were summarized and their statistical properties were compared. The answer to which design and method is more powerful was more nuanced than what was previously reported. For both nested case-control and case-cohort designs, inverse probability weighting methods were more powerful than the standard methods. However, the difference became negligible when the proportion of failure events was very low ({$<$}1\%) in the full cohort. The comparison between two designs depended on the censoring types and incidence proportion: with random censoring, nested case-control designs coupled with the inverse probability weighting method yielded the highest statistical power among all methods for both designs. With fixed censoring times, there was little difference in efficiency between two designs when inverse probability weighting methods were used; however, the standard case-cohort methods were more powerful than the conditional logistic method for nested case-control designs. As the proportion of failure events in the full cohort became smaller ({$<$}10\%), nested case-control methods outperformed all case-cohort methods and the choice of analytic methods within each design became less important. When the predictor of interest was binary, the standard case-cohort methods were often more powerful than the conditional logistic method for nested case-control designs.},

Iron is essential for normal development and functions of the brain; however, excess redox-active iron can also lead to oxidative damage and cell death. Especially for terminally differentiated cells like neurons, regulation of reactive oxygen species is critical for cell viability. As a result, cellular iron level is tightly regulated. Although iron accumulation related to neurological diseases has been well documented, the pathoetiological contributions of the homeostatic iron regulator (HFE), which controls cellular iron uptake, is less understood. Furthermore, a common HFE variant, H63D HFE, has been identified as a modifier of multiple neurological diseases. This review will discuss the roles of iron and HFE in the brain as well as their impact on various disease processes.},

In this study, we comprehensively review the literature to investigate the effects of statins on various psychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and dementia. In addition, we review adverse effects and drug interactions of statins to give clinically useful information guiding statin use in the psychiatric field. Statins seem useful in reducing depression, particularly in patients with physical disorders such as cardiovascular disease. In patients with schizophrenia, negative symptoms may be reduced by adjuvant statin therapy. Studies on cohorts at risk for dementia have generally shown protective effects of statins, while those on treatment for dementia show inconsistent results. In conclusion, statins used in combination with conventional psychotropic medications may be effective for various psychiatric disorders including depression, schizophrenia, and dementia. Further study is required to determine optimal doses and duration of statin use for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Objective Telomeres are required for maintaining genomic integrity and may play a role in carcinogenesis. Some, but not all, epidemiologic studies have found that short telomeres in leukocytes are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. To further elucidate this potential association, we examined telomere length in relation to breast cancer risk in prospectively collected blood samples from the Sister Study, a cohort of women aged 35-74 years who have a sister with breast cancer. Methods We performed a case-cohort analysis comparing incident breast cancer cases (n=342) with a subcohort (n=735), randomly selected from 29,026 participants enrolled by June 1, 2007. Relative telomere length in peripheral blood cells was estimated using a single tube monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR assay. Results No association was observed between telomere length and breast cancer risk. Compared to the longest quartile, hazard ratios (HR) associated with the second, third and the shortest quartile were 0.91 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 0.62-1.34), 1.11 (95\% CI: 0.77-1.60) and 0.93 (95\% CI: 0.64-1.35), respectively. Subgroup analyses by menopausal status, invasiveness or estrogen-receptor status of breast cancer did not reveal evidence of association between telomere length in blood cells and subsequent breast cancer risk. Conclusions This prospective investigation does not support telomere length in blood cells as a biomarker for breast cancer risk.},

  abstract = {Socioeconomic status (SES) is a complex construct of multiple indicators, known to impact cancer outcomes, but has not been adequately examined among pediatric AML patients. This study aimed to identify the patterns of co-occurrence of multiple community-level SES indicators and to explore associations between various patterns of these indicators and pediatric AML mortality risk. A nationally representative US sample of 3651 pediatric AML patients, aged 0–19 years at diagnosis was drawn from 17 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database registries created between 1973 and 2012. Factor analysis, cluster analysis, stratified univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used. Four SES factors accounting for 87\% of the variance in SES indicators were identified: F1) economic/educational disadvantage, less immigration; F2) immigration-related features (foreignborn, language-isolation, crowding), less mobility; F3) housing instability; and, F4) absence of moving. F1 and F3 showed elevated risk of mortality, adjusted hazards ratios (aHR) (95\% CI): 1.07(1.02–1.12) and 1.05(1.00–1.10), respectively. Seven SES-defined cluster groups were identified. Cluster 1 (low economic/ educational disadvantage, few immigration-related features, and residential-stability) showed the minimum risk of mortality. Compared to Cluster 1, Cluster 3 (high economic/educational disadvantage, high-mobility) and Cluster 6 (moderately-high economic/educational disadvantages, housing-instability and immigration-related features) exhibited substantially greater risk of mortality, aHR(95\% CI) = 1.19 (1.0–1.4) and 1.23 (1.1–1.5), respectively. Factors of correlated SES-indicators and their pattern-based groups demonstrated differential risks in the pediatric AML mortality indicating the need of special public-health attention in areas with economic-educational disadvantages, housing-instability and immigration-related features.},

  abstract = {Background The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ-LC13) assesses quality of life (QOL) in patients with lung cancer and was the first EORTC module developed for use in international clinical trials. Since its publication in 1994, major treatment advances with possible effects on QOL have occurred. These changes called for an update of the module and its international psychometric validation. We aimed to investigate the scale structure and psychometric properties of the updated lung cancer module, QLQ-LC29, in patients with lung cancer. Methods This international, observational field study was done in 19 hospitals across 12 countries. Patients aged older than 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer and no other previous primary tumour, and who were mentally fit with sufficient language skills to understand and complete the questionnaire were included. Patients were asked during a hospital visit to fill in the paper versions of the core questionnaire EORTC QLQ-C30 plus QLQ-LC29, and investigators selected half of these patients to complete the questionnaire again 2–4 weeks later. Our primary aim was to assess the scale structure and psychometric properties of EORTC QLQ-LC29. We analysed scale structure using confirmatory factor analysis; reliability using Cronbach's α value (internal consistency) and intra-class coefficient (test–retest reliability); sensitivity using independent t tests stratified by Karnofsky performance status; and responsiveness to change over time by ANOVA. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02745691. Findings Between April 12, 2016, and Sept 26, 2018, 523 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of either non-small-cell lung cancer (n=442) or small-cell lung cancer (n=81) were recruited. Confirmatory factor analysis provided a solution composed of five multi-item scales (coughing, shortness of breath, fear of progression, hair problems, and surgery-related symptoms) plus 15 single symptom or side-effect items: χ2=370·233, root mean square error of approximation=0·075, and comparative-fit index=0·901. Cronbach's α for internal consistencies of all multi-item scales were above the threshold of 0·70. Intra-class coefficients for test–retest reliabilities ranged between 0·82 and 0·97. Three (shortness of breath, fear of progression, and hair problems) of the five multi-item scales showed responsiveness to change over time (p values {$<$}0·05), as did nine of 15 single symptom items. Four (coughing, shortness of breath, fear of progression, and surgery-related symptoms) of the five multi-item scales and ten of the 15 single symptom items were sensitive to known group differences (ie, lower vs higher Karnofsky performance status). Interpretation Results determined the psychometric properties of the updated lung cancer module, which is ready for use in international clinical studies. Funding EORTC Quality of Life Group.},

Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are developed. The finite sample properties of case–cohort estimator and its relative efficiency to full cohort estimator are assessed via simulation studies.

This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

Our results showed that genetically determined variations in the antioxidant enzyme activities of SOD1, CAT and GSR were not associated with risk of breast cancer per se. However, intake of alcohol, fruit and vegetables, and smoking status interacted with some of the polymorphisms in relation to breast cancer risk. Four polymorphisms were strongly associated with enzyme activity, but there was no interaction between any of the studied environmental factors and the polymorphisms in relation to enzyme activity. Additionally, single measurement of enzyme activity at entry to the cohort was not associated with risk of breast cancer. Our results therefore suggest that the antioxidant enzyme activities studied here are not major determinants of breast cancer risk.},

  abstract = {Production of minute concentrations of superoxide (O2−) and nitrogen monoxide (nitric oxide, NO) plays important roles in several aspects of cellular signaling and metabolic regulation. However, in an inflammatory environment, the concentrations of these radicals can drastically increase and the antioxidant defenses may become overwhelmed. Thus, biological damage may occur owing to redox imbalance—a condition called oxidative and/or nitrosative stress. A complex interplay exists between iron metabolism, O2−, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and NO. Iron is involved in both the formation and the scavenging of these species. Iron deficiency (anemia) (ID(A)) is associated with oxidative stress, but its role in the induction of nitrosative stress is largely unclear. Moreover, oral as well as intravenous (iv) iron preparations used for the treatment of ID(A) may also induce oxidative and/or nitrosative stress. Oral administration of ferrous salts may lead to high transferrin saturation levels and, thus, formation of non-transferrin-bound iron, a potentially toxic form of iron with a propensity to induce oxidative stress. One of the factors that determine the likelihood of oxidative and nitrosative stress induced upon administration of an iv iron complex is the amount of labile (or weakly-bound) iron present in the complex. Stable dextran-based iron complexes used for iv therapy, although they contain only negligible amounts of labile iron, can induce oxidative and/or nitrosative stress through so far unknown mechanisms. In this review, after summarizing the main features of iron metabolism and its complex interplay with O2−, H2O2, NO, and other more reactive compounds derived from these species, the potential of various iron therapies to induce oxidative and nitrosative stress is discussed and possible underlying mechanisms are proposed. Understanding the mechanisms, by which various iron formulations may induce oxidative and nitrosative stress, will help us develop better tolerated and more efficient therapies for various dysfunctions of iron metabolism.},

We develop a latent class modeling approach for joint analysis of high-dimensional semicontinuous biomarker data and a binary disease outcome. To model the relationship between complex biomarker expression patterns and disease risk, we use latent risk classes to link the 2 modeling components. We characterize complex biomarker-specific differences through biomarker-specific random effects, so that different biomarkers can have different baseline (low-risk) values as well as different between-class differences. The proposed approach also accommodates data features that are common in environmental toxicology and other biomarker exposure data, including a large number of biomarkers, numerous zero values, and complex mean–variance relationship in the biomarkers levels. A Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation. Both the MCEM algorithm and model selection procedures are shown to work well in simulations and applications. In applying the proposed approach to an epidemiological study that examined the relationship between environmental polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and the risk of endometriosis, we identified a highly significant overall effect of PCB concentrations on the risk of endometriosis.},

  abstract = {Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have long been known to be related to poorer health across the life course. Previous studies typically relied on cumulative risk scores or individual adversities measured through retrospective self-reports. However, these approaches have important limitations. Cumulative risk scores assume equal weighting of adversities and the single adversity approach ignores the high probability that adversities co-occur. In contrast, latent class analysis (LCA) offers an alternative approach to operationalise ACEs that respects the clustering of adversities and may identify specific patterns of ACEs important for health outcomes. Furthermore, prospective and retrospective reports of ACEs show poor agreement. Therefore, it is important to compare findings based on prospective and retrospective measures in the same individuals. Despite an increasing number of studies applying LCA to ACEs data, no studies have yet simultaneously investigated LCA to cumulative risk and single adversity approaches in their relationships with adult inflammation. Identifying the specific ACEs or combinations of ACEs which are strongly related to inflammation is important for investigating the mechanisms involved and the planning of effective interventions. Methods Using data on 8810 members of the 1958 British birth cohort we investigated 12 ACEs – physical, psychological and sexual abuse, physical and emotional neglect, parental mental health problems, witnessing abuse, parental conflict, parental divorce, parental offending, parental substance misuse and parental death. LCA was applied to explore the clustering of prospectively and retrospectively reported ACEs separately. Associations between latent classes, cumulative risk scores and individual adversities with three inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein, fibrinogen and von Willebrand Factor) were tested using linear regression. Results There was co-occurrence between adversities, and particularly for retrospectively reported adversities. Three latent classes were identified in the prospective data – ‘Low ACEs’ (95.7\%), ‘Household dysfunction’ (2.8\%) and ‘Parental loss’ (1.5\%) which were related to increased inflammation in mid-life, as were high ACE scores and individual measures of offending, death, divorce, physical neglect and family conflict. Four latent classes were identified in the retrospective data – ‘Low ACEs’, ‘Parental mental health and substance misuse’, ‘Maltreatment and conflict’ and ‘Polyadversity.’ The latter two (5.2\%) were related to raised inflammation in mid-life, as was a retrospective ACE score of 4+ (8.3\%) and individual measures of family conflict, psychological and physical abuse, emotional neglect and witnessing abuse. Conclusions Specific ACEs or ACE combinations might be important for chronic inflammation. LCA is an alternative approach to operationalising ACEs data but further research is needed.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Biological variation consists of within-person (WP) and between-person (BP) variation. These components of biological variation are used to set analytical goals for imprecision and bias, evaluate serial changes for individual analytes, and assess the clinical utility of population-based reference intervals. Estimates of WP coefficients of variation (CVw) and BP coefficients of variation (CVg) for laboratory analytes were estimated from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS: NHANES is a survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population that uses a stratified, multistage probability design to collect a nationally representative sample. Between- and within-person variations were estimated for 34 laboratory analytes, including general biochemical, nutritional, and environmental analytes. Between-person variation was estimated taking into account the complex sample design of NHANES by Taylor series linearization. For WP variation, a nonrandom sample was obtained with an average of 18.8 days (range: 3-51 days) between two analyte measurements. Data outliers were excluded using Tukey's method to obtain more stable estimates of variation. RESULTS: The BP and WP variations were estimated on as many as 18,761 and 853 sample persons, respectively. When compared with the BP sample, the WP sample was older (mean age: 39 compared with 30 years) and had more non-Hispanic white (45\% compared with 37\%) and fewer Mexican-American (19\% compared with 30\%) persons. There was no statistically significant difference in gender proportions between the BP and WP samples. Serum sodium had the lowest CVg (1.8\%) and the lowest CVw (1.0\%). The index of individuality (CVw/CVg) ranged from 0.20 for blood lead to 0.76 for serum iron. The CVg exceeded the analytical method coefficient of variation for all analytes. Within-person variation was also compared between males and females, and several analytes revealed significant differences (p {$<$} 0.01). Serum ferritin had the greatest difference for CVw (males, 17.9\% compared with females, 28.8\%).},

A widely recommended approach within a frequentist framework is to test for equivalence. In equivalence tests, such as the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure discussed in this article, an upper and lower equivalence bound is specified based on the smallest effect size of interest. The TOST procedure can be used to statistically reject the presence of effects large enough to be considered worthwhile. This practical primer with accompanying spreadsheet and R package enables psychologists to easily perform equivalence tests (and power analyses) by setting equivalence bounds based on standardized effect sizes and provides recommendations to prespecify equivalence bounds.

  abstract = {Objective To determine the day-to-day variation in biochemical measures of iron status in a group of elderly women with rheumatoid arthritis compared with a group of healthy elderly women. Design Venous blood samples were collected from each subject on 3 nonconsecutive days during a 2-week study period; subjects had fasted overnight. Variability in hemoglobin level, hematocrit value, serum iron concentration, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin concentration, and plasma transferrin receptor level was determined. Subjects Two groups of women, one with rheumatoid arthritis (n=10) and another that was apparently healthy (n=10). Statistical analyses Variance component analysis was used to estimate the biological variation (σ2day) and analytic variation (σ2rep) for each iron index. The coefficient of variation (CV) for each variance component was calculated: coefficient of biological variation = CVday, coefficient of analytic variation = CVrep, and coefficient of a single future determination = CVfd. Results The CVrep for all iron indexes was smaller than the CVday in both groups. The CVday was considerably higher for serum iron concentration and for transferrin saturation than for the other indexes in both groups (16.6\% arid 16.6\% in healthy subjects and 33.6\% and 28.2\%, respectively, in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis). The higher CVday for serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation translated into a higher CVfd for these indexes. Because of the higher variance for these two indexes, more sampling days were required for reliable estimates. CVda and CVfd for plasma transferrin receptor level were relatively low. Conclusions These findings corroborate our previous finding that variation of serum ferritin concentration in the elderly is lower than that demonstrated in younger populations. This aging effect persists in the presence of rheumatoid arthritis. Fasting appeared to improve reliability in the determinations for serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation. Variability estimates for the indexes other than serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation were not altered by the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis. Plasma transferrin receptor level is a reliable index for assessing iron status in populations with rheumatoid arthritis. J Am Diet Assoc. 1996; 96:247-251.},

  abstract = {A cornerstone of epidemiologic research is to understand the causal pathways from an exposure to an outcome. Mediation analysis based on counterfactuals is an important tool when addressing such questions. However, none of the existing techniques for formal mediation analysis can be applied to survival data. This is a severe shortcoming, as many epidemiologic questions can be addressed only with censored survival data. A solution has been to use a number of Cox models (with and without the potential mediator), but this approach does not allow a causal interpretation and is not mathematically consistent. In this paper, we propose a simple measure of mediation in a survival setting. The measure is based on counterfactuals, and measures the natural direct and indirect effects. The method allows a causal interpretation of the mediated effect (in terms of additional cases per unit of time) and is mathematically consistent. The technique is illustrated by analyzing socioeconomic status, work environment, and long-term sickness absence. A detailed implementation guide is included in an online eAppendix (http://links.lww.com/EDE/A476).},

  abstract = {Background Mediation analysis tests whether the relationship between two variables is explained by a third intermediate variable. We sought to describe the usage and reporting of mediation analysis with time-to-event outcomes in published healthcare research. Methods A systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Web of Science was executed in December 2016 to identify applications of mediation analysis to healthcare research involving a clinically relevant time-to-event outcome. We summarized usage over time and reporting of important methodological characteristics. Results We included 149 primary studies, published from 1997 to 2016. Most studies were published after 2011 (n\,=\,110, 74\%), and the annual number of studies nearly doubled in the last year (from n\,=\,21 to n\,=\,40). A traditional approach (causal steps or change in coefficient) was most commonly taken (n\,=\,87, 58\%), and the majority of studies (n\,=\,114, 77\%) used a Cox Proportional Hazards regression for the outcome. Few studies (n\,=\,52, 35\%) mentioned any of the assumptions or limitations fundamental to a causal interpretation of mediation analysis. Conclusion There is increasing use of mediation analysis with time-to-event outcomes. Current usage is limited by reliance on traditional methods and the Cox Proportional Hazards model, as well as low rates of reporting of underlying assumptions. There is a need for formal criteria to aid authors, reviewers, and readers reporting or appraising such studies.

  abstract = {Background Oxidative stress and detoxification mechanisms have been commonly studied in Prostate Cancer (PCa) due to their function in the detoxification of potentially damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and carcinogens. However, findings have been either inconsistent or inconclusive. These mixed findings may, in part, relate to failure to consider interactions among oxidative stress response related genetic variants along with pro- and antioxidant factors. Methods We examined the effects of 33 genetic and 26 environmental oxidative stress and defense factors on PCa risk and disease aggressiveness among 2,286 men from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility project (1,175 cases, 1,111 controls). Single and joint effects were analyzed using a comprehensive statistical approach involving logistic regression, multi-dimensionality reduction, and entropy graphs. Results Inheritance of one CYP2C8 rs7909236 T or two SOD2 rs2758331 A alleles was linked to a 1.3- and 1.4-fold increase in risk of developing PCa, respectively (p-value = 0.006–0.013). Carriers of CYP1B1 rs1800440GG, CYP2C8 rs1058932TC and, NAT2 (rs1208GG, rs1390358CC, rs7832071TT) genotypes were associated with a 1.3 to 2.2-fold increase in aggressive PCa [p-value = 0.04–0.001, FDR 0.088–0.939]. We observed a 23\% reduction in aggressive disease linked to inheritance of one or more NAT2 rs4646247 A alleles (p = 0.04, FDR = 0.405). Only three NAT2 sequence variants remained significant after adjusting for multiple hypotheses testing, namely NAT2 rs1208, rs1390358, and rs7832071. Lastly, there were no significant gene-environment or gene-gene interactions associated with PCa outcomes. Conclusions Variations in genes involved in oxidative stress and defense pathways may modify PCa. Our findings do not firmly support the role of oxidative stress genetic variants combined with lifestyle/environmental factors as modifiers of PCa and disease progression. However, additional multi-center studies poised to pool genetic and environmental data are needed to make strong conclusions.},

  abstract = {Human hemochromatosis protein (HFE) is involved in iron metabolism. Two major HFE polymorphisms, H63D and C282Y, have been associated with an increased risk of cancers. Previously, we reported decreased gender effects in overall survival based on H63D or C282Y HFE polymorphisms patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the effect of other single nucleotide variation (SNV) in the HFE gene on the cancer development and progression has not been systematically studied. To expand our finding in a larger sample, and to identify other HFE SNV, we analyzed the frequency of somatic SNV in HFE gene and its relationship to survival in GBM patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM (Caucasian only) database. We found 9 SNVs with increased frequency in blood normal of TCGA GBM patients compared to the 1000Genome. Among 9 SNVs, 7 SNVs were located in the intron and 2 SNVs (i.e., H63D, C282Y) in the exon of HFE gene. The statistical analysis demonstrated that blood normal samples of TCGA GBM have more H63D (p = 0.0002, 95\% Confidence interval (CI): 0.2119-0.3223) or C282Y (p = 0.0129, 95\% CI: 0.0474-0.1159) HFE polymorphisms than 1000Genome. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the 264 GBM samples revealed no difference between wild type (WT) HFE and H63D, and WT HFE and C282Y GBM patients. In addition, there was no difference in the survival of male/female GBM patients based on HFE genotype. There was no correlation between HFE expression and survival. In conclusion, the current results suggest that somatic HFE polymorphisms do not impact GBM patients' survival in the TCGA data set of GBM.},

However, few studies have included visuoconstructional ability or used latent mixture modeling to statistically identify MCI subtypes. Therefore, we examined whether unique neuropsychological MCI profiles could be ascertained using latent profile analysis (LPA), and subsequently investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, genotype, and longitudinal clinical outcomes between the empirically derived classes.               Methods:               A total of 806 participants diagnosed by means of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MCI criteria received a comprehensive neuropsychological battery assessing visuoconstructional ability, language, attention/executive function, and episodic memory. Test scores were adjusted for demographic characteristics using standardized regression coefficients based on “robust” normal control performance (               n               =260). Calculated               Z               -scores were subsequently used in the LPA, and CSF-derived biomarkers, genotype, and longitudinal clinical outcome were evaluated between the LPA-derived MCI classes.               Results:               Statistical fit indices suggested a 3-class model was the optimal LPA solution. The three-class LPA consisted of a mixed impairment MCI class (               n               =106), an amnestic MCI class (               n               =455), and an LPA-derived normal class (               n               =245). Additionally, the amnestic and mixed classes were more likely to be apolipoprotein e4+ and have worse Alzheimer’s disease CSF biomarkers than LPA-derived normal subjects.               Conclusions:               Our study supports significant heterogeneity in MCI neuropsychological profiles using LPA and extends prior work (Edmonds et al., 2015) by demonstrating a lower rate of progression in the approximately one-third of ADNI MCI individuals who may represent “false-positive” diagnoses. Our results underscore the importance of using sensitive, actuarial methods for diagnosing MCI, as current diagnostic methods may be over-inclusive.

  abstract = {Iron (Fe) is critical for proliferation, but its precise role in cell cycle progression remains unclear. In this study, we examined the mechanisms involved by assessing the effects of Fe chelators on the expression of molecules that play key roles in this process. In initial studies, gene arrays were used to assess gene expression after incubating cells with 2 Fe chelators, namely, desferrioxamine (DFO) and 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311), or the DNA-damaging agent, actinomycin D. From the genes assessed, only the N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) was specifically up-regulated by Fe chelation. Although the function of Ndrg1 is unclear, previous studies showed it markedly slows tumor growth and acts as a potent metastasis suppressor. Incubation of cells with chelators markedly increased Ndrg1 mRNA and protein expression, but this was not found with their Fe complexes or when the Fe-binding site had been inactivated. Increased Ndrg1 expression following Fe chelation was related to the permeability and antiproliferative activity of chelators and could be reversed by Fe repletion. Moreover, Ndrg1 up-regulation after chelation occurred at the transcriptional level and was mediated by hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Our investigation suggests Ndrg1 is a novel link between Fe metabolism and the control of proliferation.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Iron is the more abundant metal ion in humans. It is essential for life as it has a role in various cellular processes involved, for instance, in cell metabolism and DNA synthesis. These functions are crucial for cell proliferation, and it is therefore not surprising that iron is accumulated in tumors. In this review, we describe normal and altered iron homeostasis mechanisms. We also provide a vision of iron-related proteins with altered expression in cancers and discuss their potential as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers. Finally, we give an overview of therapeutic strategies acting on iron metabolism to fight against cancers. Abstract Iron (Fe) is a trace element that plays essential roles in various biological processes such as DNA synthesis and repair, as well as cellular energy production and oxygen transport, and it is currently widely recognized that iron homeostasis is dysregulated in many cancers. Indeed, several iron homeostasis proteins may be responsible for malignant tumor initiation, proliferation, and for the metastatic spread of tumors. A large number of studies demonstrated the potential clinical value of utilizing these deregulated proteins as prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers of malignancy and/or response to anticancer treatments. Additionally, the iron present in cancer cells and the importance of iron in ferroptosis cell death signaling pathways prompted the development of therapeutic strategies against advanced stage or resistant cancers. In this review, we select relevant and promising studies in the field of iron metabolism in cancer research and clinical oncology. Besides this, we discuss some co-existing discrepant findings. We also present and discuss the latest lines of research related to targeting iron, or its regulatory pathways, as potential promising anticancer strategies for human therapy. Iron chelators, such as deferoxamine or iron-oxide-based nanoparticles, which are already tested in clinical trials, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, are also reported.},

  abstract = {The role of altered redox status and high reactive oxygen species (ROS) is still controversial in cancer development and progression. Intracellular levels of ROS are elevated in cancer cells suggesting a role in cancer initiation and progression; on the contrary, ROS elevated levels may induce programmed cell death and have been associated with cancer suppression. Thus, it is crucial to consider the double-face of ROS, for novel therapeutic strategies targeting redox regulatory mechanisms. In this review, in order to derive cancer-type specific oxidative stress genes' profile and their potential prognostic role, we integrated a publicly available oxidative stress gene signature with patient survival data from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Overall, we found several genes statistically significant associated with poor prognosis in the examined six tumor types. Among them, FoxM1 and thioredoxin reductase1 expression showed the same pattern in four out of six cancers, suggesting their specific critical role in cancer-related oxidative stress adaptation. Our analysis also unveiled an enriched cellular network, highlighting specific pathways, in which many genes are strictly correlated. Finally, we discussed novel findings on the correlation between oxidative stress and cancer stem cells in order to define those pathways to be prioritized in drug development.},

  abstract = {Since anemia is associated with poor health outcomes, the prevalence of anemia is a significant public health indicator. Even though anemia is primarily caused by iron deficiency, low oxygen-carrying capacity may result from other conditions such as chronic diseases, which remain a relevant health concern in the United States. However, studies examining current rates of anemia in the total US population and in more specific subgroups are limited. Data from five National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 2003 to 2012 were analyzed to assess two outcomes: anemia and moderate-severe anemia, which were based upon serum hemoglobin levels (Hb) as per World Health Organization (WHO) definitions. Statistical analysis using SAS examined temporal trends and the prevalence of anemia among sexes, age groups, and races/ethnicities. The study estimated that an average of 5.6\% of the U.S. population met the criteria for anemia and 1.5\% for moderate-severe anemia during this 10-year period. High-risk groups such as pregnant women, elderly persons, women of reproductive age, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics were identified, and relationships between multiple risk factors were examined. Rates of anemia in men increased monotonically with age, while that of women increased bimodally with peaks in age group 40–49 years and 80–85 years. The effect of risk factors was observed to compound. For instance, the prevalence of anemia in black women aged 80–85 years was 35.6\%, 6.4 times higher than the population average. Moreover, anemia is a growing problem because of the increased prevalence of anemia (4.0\% to 7.1\%) and moderate-severe anemia (1.0\% to 1.9\%), which nearly doubled from 2003–2004 to 2011–2012. Thus, these results augment the current knowledge on anemia prevalence, severity, and distribution among subgroups in the US and raised anemia as an issue that requires urgent public health intervention.},

A human osteosarcoma 143B cell line in vitro and 143B xenograft in nude mice in vivo were utilized, the anticancer effects of Dp44mT were examined through methods of MTT assay, transwell, wound healing assay, flow cytometry, western blot, immunohistochemistry and H\&E staining. We showed that Dp44mT inhibits cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro. In addition, flow cytometry further illustrated that Dp44mT suppression of 143B cell proliferation, invasion and migration were partially due to induction of cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest in S phase and ROS production. Also in vitro and in vivo, the expression levels of Bcl2, Bax, Caspase3, Caspase9, LC3-II, β-catenin and its downstream targets such as C-myc and Cyclin D1 demonstrated that cell apoptosis and autophagy, as well as Wnt/β-catenin pathway were involved in Dp44mT induced osteosarcoma suppression. The Dp44mT inhibition of osteosarcoma was further verified via animal models. The findings indicated that in vivo Dp44mT showed a significant reduction in the 143B xenograft tumor growth and metastasis. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that Dp44mT has effective anticancer capability in osteosarcoma and that may represent a promising treatment strategy for osteosarcoma.},

  abstract = {A re-analysis of intraclass correlation (ICC) theory is presented together with Monte Carlo simulations of ICC probability distributions. A partly revised and simplified theory of the single-score ICC is obtained, together with an alternative and simple recipe for its use in reliability studies. Our main, practical conclusion is that in the analysis of a reliability study it is neither necessary nor convenient to start from an initial choice of a specified statistical model. Rather, one may impartially use all three single-score ICC formulas. A near equality of the three ICC values indicates the absence of bias (systematic error), in which case the classical (one-way random) ICC may be used. A consistency ICC larger than absolute agreement ICC indicates the presence of non-negligible bias; if so, classical ICC is invalid and misleading. An F-test may be used to confirm whether biases are present. From the resulting model (without or with bias) variances and confidence intervals may then be calculated. In presence of bias, both absolute agreement ICC and consistency ICC should be reported, since they give different and complementary information about the reliability of the method. A clinical example with data from the literature is given.},

  abstract = {Background: In method comparison studies, it is of importance to assure that the presence of a difference of medical importance is detected. For a given difference, the necessary number of samples depends on the range of values and the analytical standard deviations of the methods involved. For typical examples, the present study evaluates the statistical power of least-squares and Deming regression analyses applied to the method comparison data. Methods: Theoretical calculations and simulations were used to consider the statistical power for detection of slope deviations from unity and intercept deviations from zero. For situations with proportional analytical standard deviations, weighted forms of regression analysis were evaluated. Results: In general, sample sizes of 40 –100 samples conventionally used in method comparison studies often must be reconsidered. A main factor is the range of values, which should be as wide as possible for the given analyte. For a range ratio (maximum value divided by minimum value) of 2, 544 samples are required to detect one standardized slope deviation; the number of required samples decreases to 64 at a range ratio of 10 (proportional analytical error). For electrolytes having very narrow ranges of values, very large sample sizes usually are necessary. In case of proportional analytical error, application of a weighted approach is important to assure an efficient analysis; e.g., for a range ratio of 10, the weighted approach reduces the requirement of samples by {$>$}50\%. Conclusions: Estimation of the necessary sample size for a method comparison study assures a valid result; either no difference is found or the existence of a relevant difference is confirmed.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Application of Deming regression analysis to interpret method comparison data presupposes specification of the squared analytical error ratio (λ), but in cases involving only single measurements by each method, this ratio may be unknown and is often assigned a default value of one. On the basis of simulations, this practice was evaluated in situations with real error ratios deviating from one. Comparisons of two electrolyte methods and two glucose methods were simulated. In the first case, misspecification of λ produced a bias that amounted to two-thirds of the maximum bias of the ordinary least-squares regression method. Standard errors and the results of hypothesis-testing also became misleading. In the second situation, a misspecified error ratio resulted only in a negligible bias. Thus, given a short range of values in relation to the measurement errors, it is important that λ is correctly estimated either from duplicate sets of measurements or, in the case of single measurement sets, specified from quality-control data. However, even with a misspecified error ratio, Deming regression analysis is likely to perform better than least-squares regression analysis.},

A computationally feasible expectation conditional maximization algorithm is developed for computing maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters. The usefulness of the proposed methodology is illustrated using both simulated and real data.},

  abstract = {Background: Data on the determinants of body iron stores in middle-aged women are sparse. Objective: We prospectively evaluated nondietary and dietary determinants of iron stores. Design: Using blood samples collected in 1989–1990, we measured plasma ferritin concentrations in 620 healthy postmenopausal women aged 44–69 y who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study. Food-frequency questionnaires completed in 1980, 1984, and 1986 were used to calculate average dietary intakes. Generalized linear regression and multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the association between plasma ferritin and its determinants. Results: Among these postmenopausal women, the median plasma ferritin concentration was 73.8 ng/mL (interquartile range: 41.6–125.8 ng/mL), 2.7\% were iron depleted (ferritin concentration Ͻ 12 ng/mL), and 9.8\% had an elevated ferritin concentration (Ͼ 200 ng/mL). Age, time since menopause, time since the last postmenopausal hormone (PMH) use, body mass index, iron supplement use, and alcohol and heme-iron intakes were positively associated with ferritin concentrations, whereas PMH use, physical activity, aspirin use, and gastrointestinal ulcer were inversely related. The association between heme-iron intake and ferritin was most apparent among the women who consumed Ͼ 30 g alcohol/d. Conclusions: Our prospective data confirm that in postmenopausal women, intakes of heme iron, supplemental iron, and alcohol are dietary determinants of plasma ferritin, and age, PMH use, body mass index, physical activity, aspirin use, and gastrointestinal ulcer are nondietary determinants.

The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in the HFE gene and breast cancer risk by meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and Embase databases, covering all related studies until March 2, 2013. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 10.0. A total of 7 studies including 1,720 cases and 18,296 controls for HFE C282Y polymorphism and 5 studies including 942 cases and 1,571 controls for HFE H63D polymorphism were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that HFE C282Y polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer under homozygotes vs. wild-type model (OR = 2.06, 95\%CI = 1.19-3.58) and recessive model (OR = 1.98, 95\%CI = 1.14-3.44) but not under heterozygotes vs. wild-type model (OR = 0.97, 95\%CI = 0.70-1.35), dominant model (OR = 1.00, 95\%CI = 0.72-1.40) and multiplicative model (OR = 1.04, 95\%CI = 0.76-1.42). However, we did not find any association between HFE H63D polymorphism and breast cancer risk under all genetic models. This current meta-analysis suggested that C282Y polymorphism rather than H63D might be associated with increased risk of breast cancer.},

  abstract = {Abstract Wnt signalling has pivotal roles in tumour progression and metastasis; however, the exact molecular mechanism of Wnt signalling in the metastatic process is as yet poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that the tumour metastasis suppressor gene, NDRG1, interacts with the Wnt receptor, LRP6, followed by blocking of the Wnt signalling, and therefore, orchestrates a cellular network that impairs the metastatic progression of tumour cells. Importantly, restoring NDRG1 expression by a small molecule compound significantly suppressed the capability of otherwise highly metastatic tumour cells to thrive in circulation and distant organs in animal models. In addition, our analysis of clinical cohorts data indicate that Wnt+/NDRG?/LRP+ signature has a strong predictable value for recurrence-free survival of cancer patients. Collectively, we have identified NDRG1 as a novel negative master regulator of Wnt signalling during the metastatic progression, which opens an opportunity to define a potential therapeutic target for metastatic disease.},

  abstract = {Meat consumption has been postulated to increase the risk of breast cancer, but this association has not been consistently seen. We examined the association between consumption of different types of meat, meat mutagens and incident invasive breast cancer. Information on consumption of different meat categories and meat cooking practice behaviors was obtained from 42,012 Sister Study participants who completed a Block 1998 Food Frequency Questionnaire at enrollment (2003–2009) and satisfied eligibility criteria. Exposure to meat type and meat mutagens was calculated, and associations with invasive breast cancer risk were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. During follow-up (mean, 7.6 years), 1,536 invasive breast cancers were diagnosed at least 1 year after enrollment. Increasing consumption of red meat was associated with increased risk of invasive breast cancer (HRhighest vs. lowest quartile:1.23, 95\% CI: 1.02–1.48, ptrend = 0.01). Conversely, increasing consumption of poultry was associated with decreased invasive breast cancer risk (HR highest vs. lowest quartile: 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.72–1.00; ptrend = 0.03). In a substitution model with combined red meat and poultry consumption held constant, substituting poultry for red meat was associated with decreased invasive breast cancer risk (HR highest vs. lowest quartile of poultry consumption: 0.72, 95\% CI: 0.58–0.89). No associations were observed for cooking practices, estimated heterocyclic amines or heme iron from red meat consumption with breast cancer risk. Red meat consumption may increase the risk of invasive breast cancer, whereas poultry consumption may be associated with reduced risk. Substituting poultry for red meat could reduce breast cancer risk.},

  abstract = {The iron status of blood donors is a subject of concern for blood establishments. The Finnish Red Cross Blood Service addresses iron loss in blood donors by proposing systematic iron supplementation for demographic at-risk donor groups. We measured blood count, ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and acquired lifestyle and health information from 2200 blood donors of the FinDonor 10000 cohort. We used modern data analysis methods to estimate iron status and factors affecting it with a special focus on the effects of the blood service’s iron supplementation policy. Low ferritin ({$<$} 15 μg/L), an indicator of low iron stores, was present in 20.6\% of pre-menopausal women, 10.6\% of post-menopausal women and 6\% of men. Anemia co-occurred with iron deficiency more frequently in pre-menopausal women (21 out of 25 cases) than in men (3/6) or post-menopausal women (1/2). In multivariable regression analyses, lifestyle, dietary, and blood donation factors explained up to 38\% of the variance in ferritin levels but only \textasciitilde 10\% of the variance in sTfR levels. Days since previous donation were positively associated with ferritin levels in all groups while the number of donations during the past 2 years was negatively associated with ferritin levels in premenopausal women and men. FRCBS-provided iron supplementation was negatively associated with ferritin levels in men only. Relative importance analyses showed that donation activity accounted for most of the explained variance in ferritin levels while iron supplementation explained less than 1\%. Variation in ferritin levels was not significantly associated with variation in self-reported health. Donation activity was the most important factor affecting blood donor iron levels, far ahead of e.g. red-meat consumption or iron supplementation. Importantly, self-reported health of donors with lower iron stores was not lower than selfreported health of donors with higher iron stores.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives There is increasing evidence that frequent blood donation depletes the iron stores of some blood donors. The FinDonor 10 000 study was set up to study iron status and factors affecting iron stores in Finnish blood donors. In Finland, iron supplementation for at-risk groups has been in place since the 1980s. Material and Methods A total of 2584 blood donors (N = 8003 samples) were recruited into the study alongside standard donation at three donation sites in the capital region of Finland between 5/2015 and 12/2017. All participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their health and lifestyle. Blood samples were collected from the sample pouch of whole blood collection set, kept in cool temperature and processed centrally. Whole blood count, CRP, ferritin and sTFR were measured from the samples, and DNA was isolated for GWAS studies. Results Participant demographics, albeit in general similar to the general blood donor population in Finland, indicated some bias towards older and more frequent donors. Participation in the study increased median donation frequency of the donors. Analysis of the effect of time lag from the sampling to the analysis and the time of day when sample was drawn revealed small but significant time-dependent changes. Conclusion The FinDonor cohort now provides us with tools to identify potential donor groups at increased risk of iron deficiency and factors explaining this risk. The increase in donation frequency during the study suggests that scientific projects can be used to increase the commitment of blood donors.},

  abstract = {Most statistical developments in the joint modelling area have focused on the shared random-effect models that include characteristics of the longitudinal marker as predictors in the model for the time-to-event. A less well-known approach is the joint latent class model which consists in assuming that a latent class structure entirely captures the correlation between the longitudinal marker trajectory and the risk of the event. Owing to its flexibility in modelling the dependency between the longitudinal marker and the event time, as well as its ability to include covariates, the joint latent class model may be particularly suited for prediction problems. This article aims at giving an overview of joint latent class modelling, especially in the prediction context. The authors introduce the model, discuss estimation and goodness-of-fit, and compare it with the shared random-effect model. Then, dynamic predictive tools derived from joint latent class models, as well as measures to evaluate their dynamic predictive accuracy, are presented. A detailed illustration of the methods is given in the context of the prediction of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy based on repeated measures of Prostate Specific Antigen.},

Therefore, 12 males were fed high-dose (4.91 µmol Se/d), medium-dose (2.61 µmol Se/d), or control (0.41 µmol Se/d) whole-wheat-bread for 1 y and the concentration of selenium was measured in toenail clippings collected every 12 wk for 2 y. Toenail selenium concentration was unaffected by dietary intake in the previous 3 mo and appeared to provide a time-integrated measure of intake over a period of 26–52 wk. Use of selenium concentration in toenail clippings may be an alternative to blood when a measure of long-term average intake is desired. The absence of a short-term effect of diet on toenail selenium concentration also makes this a useful marker of intake in retrospective studies.},

This finding might result from reduced menstrual losses secondary to oligo- or amenorrhea or from hyperinsulinism secondary to insulin resistance, because insulin favors the intestinal absorption and the tissue deposition of iron. To explore which of these mechanisms is responsible for the increase in body iron stores in women with PCOS, we have monitored the changes in serum ferritin levels during treatment with an antiandrogenic oral contraceptive or an insulin sensitizer. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Thirty-four consecutive PCOS patients were randomized to an oral contraceptive containing 35 μg ethinyl-estradiol plus 2 mg cyproterone acetate (Diane35 Diario) or metformin (850 mg twice daily), and their serum ferritin levels were evaluated at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. RESULTS—Despite the fact that treatment with Diane35 Diario restored regular menstrual cycles in all the patients, whereas metformin only did so in 50\% of them, serum ferritin levels decreased at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment only with metformin, in association with a marked increase in insulin sensitivity. On the contrary, no changes in ferritin and insulin sensitivity were observed with Diane35 Diario. CONCLUSIONS—Our present results suggest that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinism, and not the reduced menstrual losses secondary to from oligo- or amenorrhea, are responsible of the increased ferritin levels and body iron stores found in overweight and obese women with PCOS.},

The BOND Iron Expert Panel (I-EP) reviewed the extant knowledge regarding iron biology, public health implications, and the relative usefulness of currently available biomarkers of iron status from deficiency to overload. Approaches to assessing intake, including bioavailability, are also covered. The report also covers technical and laboratory considerations for the use of available biomarkers of iron status, and concludes with a description of research priorities along with a brief discussion of new biomarkers with potential for use across the spectrum of activities related to the study of iron in human health.The I-EP concluded that current iron biomarkers are reliable for accurately assessing many aspects of iron nutrition. However, a clear distinction is made between the relative strengths of biomarkers to assess hematological consequences of iron deficiency versus other putative functional outcomes, particularly the relationship between maternal and fetal iron status during pregnancy, birth outcomes, and infant cognitive, motor and emotional development. The I-EP also highlighted the importance of considering the confounding effects of inflammation and infection on the interpretation of iron biomarker results, as well as the impact of life stage. Finally, alternative approaches to the evaluation of the risk for nutritional iron overload at the population level are presented, because the currently designated upper limits for the biomarker generally employed (serum ferritin) may not differentiate between true iron overload and the effects of subclinical inflammation.},

Dependent users displayed significantly higher concentrations in hair and toenail samples compared to recreational users. Cocaine abstinence could be monitored in hair and toenail samples. One postmortem fingernail was analyzed in layers to investigate the cocaine and metabolite concentration profile. Highest concentrations were observed in the dorsal layer, being indicative of contamination. Conclusion: Having led to comparable results, toenails may be an alternative for retrospective monitoring of cocaine consumption/abstinence. Hair should remain the first choice for assessment of temporal evidence of drug intake.},

  abstract = {Nails are attracting increasing interest in forensic toxicology as an alternative to hair. The goal of this study was to systematically investigate the incorporation of drugs in fingernails after single drug dose, exemplified for zolpidem. Fingernail samples from ring fingers were collected one week before, and then 24 h and weekly after intake for a period of three to five months. Hair samples were taken six weeks after intake. Nail specimens were pulverized and extracted with methanol (internal standard: zolpidem-D6) under sonication. Extracts were analyzed by a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) method, which was developed and validated for this study. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for a 5-mg sample was 0.1 pg/mg nail. Zolpidem was detected continuously in fingernail clippings. The mean window of detection of zolpidem in fingernail clippings was 3.5 months. Unwashed nail specimens taken 24 h after intake showed the highest zolpidem concentrations indicating external contamination by sweat. External contamination experiments revealed that zolpidem could be incorporated in fingernails by sweat to such an extent that it remained irremovable by daily hygiene. Averagely 3 months after intake a concentration peak was reached, suggesting outgrowth of the nail part which had been formed while the drug circulated in blood. Hair concentrations were higher than the maximum nail concentrations. Pigmented hair contained more zolpidem than non-pigmented hair from the same strand. From all these results it can be concluded, that fingernail clippings may represent a useful alternative and/or complementary matrix in cases of, for example, drug-facilitated sexual assault or monitoring of constant consumption behavior.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between elevated serum transferrin saturation and mortality., METHODS This cohort study was conducted using data from the First Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I (1971–1974) (NHANES I) merged with the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study (1992) (N = 10,714). We used SUDAAN and appropriate weights to make population estimates for the adult US population (aged 25 to 74 years at baseline). All-cause mortality was evaluated in relation to serum transferrin saturation of greater than 45\%, greater than 50\%, greater than 55\%, and greater than 60\% using Cox proportional hazards regression., RESULTS In a Cox proportional hazards model controlling for potential confounders, including comorbid diseases, smoking, and cholesterol, all-cause mortality is significantly greater for persons with a serum transferrin saturation of more than 55\%, compared with those with saturations below this cutoff (hazards ratio [HR] =1.60, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.17–2.21). No one who died had hemochromatosis as any of the 20 listed causes of death. Many of the underlying causes of death for persons with serum transferrin saturation levels of more than 55\% are common causes of death in the general population, although these persons were more likely to have died of cirrhosis and diabetes, a finding consistent with iron overload., CONCLUSIONS In this nationally representative cohort of adults, those with elevated serum transferrin saturation, more than 2\% of the adult US population, were at increased risk for all-cause mortality.},

  abstract = {Iron overload is associated with significant morbidity and mortality yet is easily treated. The objective of this study was to create a tool that could be easily adapted to clinical practice that indicates the likelihood of a patient having undetected iron overload. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2002 for US adults aged 20 years and older to build a model (unweighted n=8,779). We chose potential variables for inclusion that could be gathered by self-report or measured without laboratory data and were suggested by past literature on hemochromatosis and iron overload. We computed logistic regressions to create the scores by initially evaluating the variables’ relationship with elevated ferritin and elevated transferrin saturation and then using odds ratios to correspond to scores. The resulting score on the IRon Overload ScreeNing Tool (IRON) was then validated with data on 13,844 adults in the NHANES III, 1988-94. Predictors in the final tool were age, gender, previous diagnoses of liver condition, osteoporosis or thyroid disease. The IRON score yielded an area under the curve (AUC) in the NHANES 1999-02 of 0.720 and an AUC of 0.685 in the NHANES III validation sample. The IRON score is a tool to assist in identification of patients with iron overload that has several qualities that make it attractive for use in clinical practice with an undifferentiated patient population including brevity, easily collected information and predictive ability comparable to other tools that help in directing screening.},

Organ damage may result from iron overload and manifest clinically as cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, endocrine abnormalities and cardiomyopathy. Hemochromatosis inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder is the most common genetic iron overload disorder.

Further testing for the hemochromatosis gene is recommended if transferrin saturation is {$>$}45\% with or without hyperferritinemia. However, management of individuals with low or normal transferrin saturation is not clear. In patients with features of iron overload and high serum ferritin levels, low or normal transferrin saturation should alert the physician to other - primary as well as secondary - causes of iron overload besides hemochromatosis. We present here a possible approach to patients with hyperferritinemia but normal transferrin saturation.},

Advances in the field over the last several decades have been remarkable and have clearly translated into better patient care as evidenced by the earlier detection, better prognosis and new targeted therapies. There have been two recent advances in the breast cancer research field that have lead to paradigm shifts: first, the identification of intrinsic breast tumor subtypes, which has changed the way we think about breast cancer and second, the recent characterization of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are suspected to be responsible for tumor initiation, recurrence and resistance to therapy. These findings have opened new exciting avenues to think about breast cancer therapeutic strategies. While these advances constitute major paradigm shifts within the research realm, the clinical arena has yet to adopt and apply our understanding of the molecular basis of the disease to early diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of breast cancers. Here, we will review the current clinical approach to classification of breast cancers, newer molecular-based classification schemes and potential future of biomarkers representing a functional classification of breast cancer.},

However, the same characteristic chemistry that makes it so biologically versatile may lead to iron-associated toxicity as a consequence of increased oxidative stress. The fact that free iron accumulates with age and generates ROS led to the hypothesis that it could be involved in the etiogenesis of several chronic diseases. Iron has been consistently linked to carcinogenesis, either through persistent failure in the redox balance or due to its critical role in cellular proliferation. Several reports have given evidence that alterations in the import, export and storage of cellular iron may contribute to breast cancer development, behavior and recurrence. In this review, we summarize the basic mechanisms of systemic and cellular iron regulation and highlight the findings that link their deregulation with breast cancer. To conclude, progresses in iron chelation therapy in breast cancer, as a tool to fight chemotherapy resistance, are also reviewed.},

  abstract = {Introduction: To determine the effect of 6-month administration of atorvastatin on hepcidin and hemojuvelin levels, inflammatory parameters and iron metabolism in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 and 4., Methods: Thirty six statin- and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-naive patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 and LDL cholesterol ≥100\,mg/dl received atorvastatin or placebo for two 6-month periods in a double blind, randomized crossover study. Hepcidin, hemojuvelin, hsCRP, IL-6, hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) were measured before and after each treatment period., Results: Hepcidin decreased (from 102 [307] to 63 [170] pg/ml (p\,{$>$}\,.001)) in the course of statin therapy but remained unchanged after placebo administration (173 [256] to 153 [204] pg/ml, respectively). Hemojuvelin did not change after either part of the study. Both IL-6 and hsCRP decreased following statin therapy (from 8.7 [12.0] to 8.1 [13.9] pg/ml; p\,=\,.04 and from 4.7 [4.0] to 4.0 [3.6] mg/l; p\,=\,.4, respectively), but did not change after placebo administration. Blood hemoglobin increased slightly but significantly after 6-month statin therapy (from 11.6\,±\,1.6 to 11.9\,±\,1.5\,g/dl, p\,=\,.002), and was unchanged after placebo treatment. TIBC and UIBC increased significantly after 6-month statin therapy, and serum iron also tended to increase. The change of eGFR during the study did not differ between the two treatment periods., Conclusions: Statin may have a small but potentially beneficial effect on serum hepcidin, which may lead to improvement of anemia control in CKD patients.},

Aspirin-induced loss of stored iron from chronic gastrointestinal bleeding is proposed as a mechanism underlying this beneficial effect. In iron depletion, less iron may be available for carcinogenesis through free-radical mediated mechanisms and for promotion of tumor growth. Low-dose aspirin increases gastrointestinal losses of transfused radiolabeled autologous red cells. Observational studies report lower serum ferritin values with regular aspirin use. A protective effect of induced iron reduction against cancer mortality has been confirmed in a recent trial (FeAST) with subjects randomized to iron reduction or observation. Serum ferritin reductions in the FeAST trial were within conventionally normal reference ranges and were quantitatively similar to ferritin reductions in observational studies in regular aspirin users. Delayed anticancer effects of aspirin are compatible with the proposed mechanism, as continual microbleeding has a gradual cumulative effect on stored iron.},

For cancer, this includes prediction of survival time from a surfeit of covariates. Such data presents an opportunity for improved prediction, but also a challenge due to high dimensionality. Furthermore, disease populations can be heterogeneous. Integrative modeling is sensible, as the underlying hypothesis is that joint analysis of multiple covariates provides greater explanatory power than separate analyses. We propose an integrative latent variable model that combines factor analysis for various data types and an exponential proportional hazards (EPH) model for continuous survival time with informative censoring. The factor and EPH models are connected through low-dimensional latent variables that can be interpreted and visualized to identify subpopulations. We use this model to predict survival time. We demonstrate this model's utility in simulation and on four Cancer Genome Atlas datasets: diffuse lower-grade glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma. These datasets have small sample sizes, high-dimensional diverse covariates, and high censorship rates. We compare the predictions from our model to three alternative models. Our model outperforms in simulation and is competitive on real datasets. Furthermore, the low-dimensional visualization for diffuse lower-grade glioma displays known subpopulations.},

The range in values within the normal groups was wide. No strong relationship was found with linear regression analysis or with multiple regression analysis of the data for the male or the female students. Other groups studied were oyster openers with a higher dietary intake of zinc from oysters, industrial workers exposed to zinc in their occupations, and hospital patients with leg ulcers or various dermatoses and with a potentially low zinc status. Only external exposure to zinc from an industrial source (galvanizing) or from the use of zinc-based creams increased the zinc concentration in the samples measured, and then only in hair and toenails. The hospital patients did not appear to have a lower zinc status comparable with adults from other countries. It was concluded that the measurement of zinc in serum, urine, hair, and toenails did not provide a sensitive indication of zinc status.},

Studies were included if they were conducted in adult populations with measures for both females and males of self-reported TEI and TEE from doubly labeled water (DLW). Studies were screened and quality assessed independently by 2 authors. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to pool the mean differences between TEI and TEE for, and between, females and males, by method of dietary assessment.From 1313 identified studies, 31 met the inclusion criteria. The studies collectively included information on 4518 individuals (54\% females). Dietary assessment methods included 24-h recalls (n~=~12, 2 with supplemental photos of food items consumed), estimated food records (EFRs; n~=~11), FFQs (n~=~10), weighed food records (WFRs, n~=~5), and diet histories (n~=~2). Meta-analyses identified underestimation of TEI by females and males, ranging from −1318 kJ/d (95\% CI: −1967, −669) for FFQ to −2650 kJ/d (95\% CI: −3492, −1807) for 24-h recalls for females, and from −1764 kJ/d (95\% CI: −2285, −1242) for FFQ to −3438 kJ/d (95\% CI: −5382, −1494) for WFR for males. There was no difference in the level of underestimation by sex, except when using EFR, for which males underestimated energy intake more than females (by 590 kJ/d, 95\% CI: 35, 1,146).Substantial underestimation of TEI across a range of dietary assessment methods was identified, similar by sex. These underestimations should be considered when assessing TEI and interpreting diet–disease relations.},

Recent studies show that the products generated during redox reactions are able to modulate pivotal processes regarding breast cancer survival, proposing a new way of looking at the events linked to oxidative stress. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the basis of oxidative stress generation in breast cancer by reviewing the two most important events that perpetuate the malignant transformation: mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage/misguided repair. In this context, the present review addresses the main events related with redox events reported in breast cancer studies, highlighting the impact of the oxidative environment on DNA damage and the role of the mitochondria as a determinant of oxidative modifications. In addition, we further discuss the main stand-out findings concerning the modulatory role of the metabolites derived from redox stresses, with a special focus on the oxidative changes detected in the breast cancer microenvironment and its systemic impact.},

We conducted a case-control study including 582 women with breast cancer and 1,569 controls free of breast cancer selected from participants in the Nurses' Health Study and the Nurses' Health Study II. Information concerning childhood diet of the nurses at ages 3-5 years was obtained from the mothers of the participants with a 30-item food-frequency questionnaire. An increased risk of breast cancer was observed among woman who had frequently consumed French fries at preschool age. For one additional serving of French fries per week, the odds ratio (OR) for breast cancer adjusted for adult life breast cancer risk factors was 1.27 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-1.44). Consumption of whole milk was associated with a slightly decreased risk of breast cancer (covariate-adjusted OR for every additional glass of milk per day = 0.90; 95\% CI = 0.820.99). Intake of none of the nutrients calculated was related to the risk of breast cancer risk in this study. These data suggest a possible association between diet before puberty and the subsequent risk of breast cancer. Differential recall of preschool diet by the mothers of cases and controls has to be considered as a possible explanation for the observed associations. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the association between preschool diet and breast cancer is reproducible in prospective data not subject to recall bias. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Recently estrogen has been implicated in non-human models of iron homeostasis. Studying iron in women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may provide insight into the relationship between iron status and hormonal status in older women. This study examines the association between HRT and iron status in women aged 50+ who took part in the 1999–2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Data were analyzed using multiple imputation, which corrects for missing data, and complex survey regression, which adjusts for NHANES sampling. Current HRT use was associated with lower ferritin (β=−34.13, p=0.0002), controlling for potential breakthrough bleeding with a hysterectomy variable. HRT was associated with lower iron stores in women of post-reproductive in the absence of uterine blood loss, indicating potential homeostatic hormonal control of iron status. This research demonstrates the utility of studying clinical hormonal therapy to advance new understandings about the basic biology of iron homeostasis in women.},

  abstract = {Changes in iron regulation characterize the malignant state. However, the pathways that effect these changes and their specific impact on prognosis remain poorly understood. We capitalized on publicly available microarray datasets comprising 674 breast cancer cases to systematically investigate how expression of genes related to iron metabolism is linked to breast cancer prognosis. Of 61 genes involved in iron regulation, 49\% were statistically significantly associated with distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Cases were divided into test and training cohorts and the supervised principal component method was used to stratify cases into risk groups. Optimal risk stratification was achieved with a model comprising 16 genes, which we term the iron regulatory gene signature (IRGS). Multivariable analysis revealed that the IRGS contributes information not captured by conventional prognostic indicators (hazard ratio 1.61; 95\% CI 1.16–2.24; p=0.004). The IRGS successfully stratified homogeneously treated patients, including ER+ patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy, both with (p=0.006) and without (p=0.03) lymph node metastases. To test whether multiple pathways were embedded within the IRGS, we evaluated the performance of two gene dyads with known roles in iron biology in ER+ patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy (n=371). For both dyads, gene combinations that minimized intracellular iron content (anti-import: TFRCLow/HFEHigh; or pro-export: FPHigh/HAMPLow) were associated with favorable prognosis (p{$<$}0.005). Although the clinical utility of the IRGS will require further evaluation, its ability to both identify high risk patients within traditionally low risk groups and low risk patients within high risk groups has the potential to affect therapeutic decision-making.},

  abstract = {Changes in iron regulation characterize the malignant state. However, the pathways that effect these changes and their specific impact on prognosis remain poorly understood. We capitalized on publicly available microarray datasets comprising 674 breast cancer cases to systematically investigate how expression of genes related to iron metabolism is linked to breast cancer prognosis. Of 61 genes involved in iron regulation, 49\% were statistically significantly associated with distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). Cases were divided into test and training cohorts and the supervised principal component method was used to stratify cases into risk groups. Optimal risk stratification was achieved with a model comprising 16 genes, which we term the iron regulatory gene signature (IRGS). Multivariable analysis revealed that the IRGS contributes information not captured by conventional prognostic indicators (hazard ratio 1.61; 95\% CI 1.16–2.24; p=0.004). The IRGS successfully stratified homogeneously treated patients, including ER+ patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy, both with (p=0.006) and without (p=0.03) lymph node metastases. To test whether multiple pathways were embedded within the IRGS, we evaluated the performance of two gene dyads with known roles in iron biology in ER+ patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy (n=371). For both dyads, gene combinations that minimized intracellular iron content (anti-import: TFRCLow/HFEHigh; or pro-export: FPHigh/HAMPLow) were associated with favorable prognosis (p{$<$}0.005). Although the clinical utility of the IRGS will require further evaluation, its ability to both identify high risk patients within traditionally low risk groups and low risk patients within high risk groups has the potential to affect therapeutic decision-making.},

  abstract = {Reproductive ecology focuses on the sensitivity of human reproduction to environmental variation. While reproductive ecology has historically focused on the relationship between energy status and reproductive outcomes, iron status is equally critical to women's reproductive health, given the wide-ranging detrimental effects of iron-deficiency anemia on maternal and infant well-being. This review interprets the vast literature on iron status and women's reproduction through an evolutionary framework. First, it will critique the evidence for iron deficiency caused by blood loss during menstruation, reinterpreting the available data as ecological variation in menses within and between populations of women. Second, it will highlight the scant but growing evidence that iron status is implicated in fertility, a relationship that has deep evolutionary roots. Third, this review proposes a new hypothesis for the transfer of iron from mother to infant via pregnancy and breastfeeding: reproductive iron withholding. In this hypothesis, mothers transfer iron to infants in a manner that helps infants avoid iron-mediated infection and oxidative stress, but trades off with potential risk of maternal and infant iron deficiency. Finally, this review explores two main factors that can modify the relationship between iron status and the gestation-lactation cycle: (1) the relationship between long-term reproductive effort (parity) and iron status and (2) supplementation schemes before and during pregnancy. The review concludes by suggesting continued research into iron homeostasis in women using evolutionary, ecological, and biocultural frameworks.},

Literature search of dietary surveys reporting intake of iron using PubMed, Internet browsers, and national nutrient databases in the period 1993–2015. Subjects. Women of reproductive age. Results. 49 dietary surveys/studies in 29 European countries were included. Belgium, Bosnia, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Northern Ireland, Serbia, Scotland, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom/England, and Wales reported a median/mean iron intake of 7.6–9.9 mg/day. Finland, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and Spain reported an intake of 10.0–10.7 mg/day. Austria, Estonia, France, and Russia reported an intake of 11.0–11.9 mg/day. Latvia and Germany reported an intake of 12.0–12.2 mg/day. Croatia, Lithuania, Portugal, and Slovakia reported an intake of 15.9–19.0 mg/day. The percentage of dietary iron consisting of heme iron, reported in 7 studies, varied from 4.3\% in United Kingdom to 25\% in Spain. Nutrient density for iron (mg iron/10 MJ, median/mean) varied from 11.8 in Sweden to 23.0 in Lithuania. The correlation between nutrient density and dietary iron was significant (). In most countries, the majority of women had a dietary iron intake below 15 mg/day. In Belgium, Denmark, Hungary, and Sweden, 91–95\% of women had an intake below 15 mg/day. In Ireland and Germany, 61–78\% had an intake below 15 mg/day. Conclusions. In Europe, 61–97\% of women have a dietary iron intake below 15 mg/day. This contributes to a low iron status in many women. We need common European standardized dietary methods, uniform dietary reference values, and uniform statistical methods to perform intercountry comparisons.},

This mandatory enrichment of cereal products was abolished in 1987. The aim was to evaluate iron status in the Danish female population before and after abolishment of iron fortification. Methods: Iron status, serum ferritin and haemoglobin, was assessed in population surveys in 1983–1984 comprising 1221 Caucasian women (1089 non-blood-donors, 130 donors) and in 1993–1994 comprising 1261 women (1155 non-blood-donors, 104 donors) equally distributed in age cohorts of 40, 50, 60 and 70 yr. Results: In the 1984 survey, median ferritin values in the four age cohorts in non-blood-donors were 44, 57, 84 and 80 μg/L, and in the 1994 survey 40, 67, 97 and 95 μg/L, respectively. In 1984, premenopausal women had median ferritin of 43 μg/L and in 1994 of 39 μg/L (NS). In 1984, postmenopausal women had median ferritin of 75 μg/L and in 1994 of 93 μg/L (P {$<$} 0.0001). The prevalence of depleted iron stores (ferritin {$<$} 16 μg/L) was not significantly different in 1984 and 1994 either in premenopausal or in postmenopausal women. The prevalence of small + depleted iron stores (ferritin ≤32 μg/L) was not significantly different in 1984 compared with 1994 either in premenopausal women (35.8\% vs. 41.0\%) (P = 0.15) or in postmenopausal women (9.7\% vs. 7.4\%) (P = 0.15). There was no significant difference between the two surveys concerning the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia (ferritin {$<$}13 μg/L and haemoglobin {$<$}5th percentile for iron replete women). From 1984 to 1994, the prevalence of iron overload (ferritin {$>$}300 μg/L) was unchanged in premenopausal women and had increased from 2.4\% to 5.5\% in postmenopausal women (P = 0.003). During the study period there was an increase in body mass index both in premenopausal and postmenopausal women (P = 0.06 and P = 0.008). Postmenopausal women displayed an increase in alcohol consumption (P {$<$} 0.0001) and a decrease in tobacco smoking (P {$<$} 0.001). In premenopausal women, there was a marked increase in the use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (P {$<$} 0.0001) in the study period, while this was unchanged in postmenopausal women. In premenopausal blood donors, median ferritin decreased from 1984 to 1994 (36 μg/L vs. 24 μg/L, P {$<$} 0.06). In postmenopausal blood donors, ferritin was not significantly different from 1984 to 1994 (50 μg/L vs. 41 μg/L, P = 0.15). Conclusion: Abolition of iron fortification reduced the median dietary iron intake in Danish women from 12 to 9 mg/d. Despite the absence of food iron fortification, from 1984 to 1994, body iron stores were unchanged in premenopausal women, whereas iron stores and the prevalence of iron overload in postmenopausal women had increased significantly. The reason appears to be the changes in dietary habits with a lower consumption of dairy products and eggs, which inhibit iron absorption, and a higher consumption of alcohol, meat and poultry, containing heme iron and enhancing iron absorption.},

  abstract = {Iron status and body iron reserves were examined in a broad spectrum of the Danish population, and sex- and age-related changes determined. Serum ferritin concentration was employed as an indicator of mobilizable body iron stores. The relationship between serum ferritin and histochemical assessment of stainable bone marrow haemosiderin iron was examined in healthy individuals, defining threshold values for serum ferritin indicating exhausted, small, normal, ample, and increased iron stores. The populations examined comprised 7241 randomly selected normal individuals with an age distribution ranging from newborn to 85 years old. The influence of factors having a significant impact on iron balance, e.g., menstruation, pregnancy, parity, and blood donation, was analysed separately. Newborns had high cord serum ferritin levels, which were to a certain extent dependent on the mother's iron status. Newborns of mothers taking iron supplementation during pregnancy had higher cord serum ferritin than newborns of mothers taking a placebo. In children, the serum ferritin level was relatively constant from 3 years of age until adolescence, where the prevalence of exhausted iron stores was 13\% in boys and 18\% in girls. In postadolescent men, there was a gradual increase in serum ferritin levels until 30 years of age. Subsequently, serum ferritin remained relatively constant until old age. Among 30- to 70-year-old men, 9.4\% had ample iron stores. The prevalence of depleted iron stores was 1.4\%, and of iron deficiency anaemia 0.24\%. In women, serum ferritin levels remained low from adolescence until the menopause. Among 30- to 50-year-old premenopausal women, the prevalence of ample iron stores was 0.49\%, whereas 18\% had exhausted iron reserves and 2.6\% had iron deficiency anaemia. After menopause, serum ferritin gradually rose and approached male levels. Among 60- to 70-year-old postmenopausal women, 3.0\% had ample iron stores, 2.3\% had depleted stores and none had iron deficiency anaemia. In fertile women, the choice of contraception had a significant influence on the iron loss at menstruation. Hormonal contraception reduced iron loss, whereas the use of intrauterine devices increased iron loss. These effects were reflected in the serum ferritin levels of menstruating women. In a placebo-controlled study of iron supplementation during pregnancy, serum ferritin levels displayed a characteristic fall both in placebo- and iron-treated women. Among placebo-treated pregnant women at term, 19\% had depleted iron reserves and 12\% had iron deficiency anaemia, and among iron-treated women, 3\% had depleted iron stores and none had iron deficiency anaemia. In non-pregnant women, there was a significant inverse relationship between parity and serum ferritin. Blood donation had a marked influence on the serum ferritin level in the adult population. Among Danes, 20-60 years of age, 27\% of men, 15\% of premenopausal and 10\% of postmenopausal women were blood donors. In all three groups, the prevalence of depleted iron depots was higher in donors than in non-donors. Among premenopausal female blood donors, 31.7\% had depleted iron reserves and 3.3\% iron deficiency anaemia. In general, Danish men and postmenopausal women had a satisfactory iron status. Adolescent Danish girls and premenopausal women had a high prevalence of iron deficiency, which should be taken into consideration when establishing guidelines and recommendations for nutritional iron intake in this section of the population.},

  abstract = {L-cysteine is currently recognized as a conditionally essential sulphur amino acid. Besides contributing to many biological pathways, cysteine is a key component of the keratin protein by its ability to form disulfide bridges that confer strength and rigidity to the protein. In addition to cysteine, iron represents another critical factor in regulating keratins expression in epidermal tissues, as well as in hair follicle growth and maturation. By focusing on human keratinocytes, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cysteine supplementation as nutraceutical on keratin biosynthesis, as well as to get an insight on the interplay of cysteine availability and cellular iron status in regulating keratins expression in vitro. Herein we demonstrate that cysteine promotes a significant up-regulation of keratins expression as a result of de novo protein synthesis, while the lack of iron impairs keratin expression. Interestingly, cysteine supplementation counteracts the adverse effect of iron deficiency on cellular keratin expression. This effect was likely mediated by the up-regulation of transferrin receptor and ferritin, the main cellular proteins involved in iron homeostasis, at last affecting the labile iron pool. In this manner, cysteine may also enhance the metabolic iron availability for DNA synthesis without creating a detrimental condition of iron overload. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first study in an in vitro keratinocyte model providing evidence that cysteine and iron cooperate for keratins expression, indicative of their central role in maintaining healthy epithelia.},

  abstract = {Purpose There is accumulating evidence that oxidative stress is an important contributor to carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that genetic variation in genes involved in maintaining antioxidant/oxidant balance would be associated with overall oxidative stress. Methods We examined associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MnSOD, GSTP1, GSTM1, GPX1, GPX3, and CAT genes and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), a blood biomarker of oxidative damage, in healthy white women randomly selected from Western New York (n = 1402). We used general linear models to calculate age-adjusted geometric means of TBARS across the variants. We also examined the associations within strata of menopausal status. Results For MnSOD, being heterozygous was associated with lower geometric means of TBARS (less oxidative stress), 1.28 mg/dL, compared to homozygous T-allele or homozygous C-allele,1.35 mg/dL, and 1.31 mg/dL correspondingly (p for trend = 0.01). This difference remained among postmenopausal women, 1.40 mg/dL for TT, 1.32 mg/dL for TC, and 1.34mg/dL for CC (p for trend 0.015); it was attenuated among premenopausal women. SNPs in the other genes examined (GSTP1, GSTM1, GPX1, GPX3, and CAT) were not associated with TBARS. Conclusions Our findings suggest that genetic variation in MnSOD gene may be associated with oxidative status, particularly among postmenopausal women.},

  abstract = {Iron plays a unique physiological role in the maintenance of homeostasis and the pathological outcomes of the female reproductive tract. The dual nature of elemental iron has created an evolutionary need to tightly regulate its biological concentration. The female reproductive tract is particularly unique due to the constant cycle of endometrial growth and shedding, in addition to the potential need for iron transfer to a developing fetus. Here, iron regulation is explored in a number of physiologic states including the endometrial lining and placenta. While iron dysregulation is a common characteristic in many women’s health pathologies there is currently a lack of targeted therapeutic options. Traditional iron therapies, including iron replacement and chelation, are common treatment options for gynecological diseases but pose long term negative health consequences; therefore, more targeted interventions directed towards iron regulation have been proposed. Recent findings show potential benefits in a therapeutic focus on ferritin-hepcidin regulation, modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and iron mediated cell death (ferroptosis). These novel therapeutics are the direct result of previous research in iron’s complex signaling pathway and show promise for improved therapy, diagnosis, and prognosis in women’s health.},

  abstract = {Background: Environmental epidemiology and biomonitoring studies typically rely on biological samples to assay the concentration of non-persistent exposure biomarkers. Between-participant variations in sampling conditions of these biological samples constitute a potential source of exposure misclassification. Few studies attempted to correct biomarker levels for this error. We aimed to assess the influence of sampling conditions on concentrations of urinary biomarkers of select phenols and phthalates, two widely-produced families of chemicals, and to standardize biomarker concentrations on sampling conditions. Methods: Urine samples were collected between 2002 and 2006 among 287 pregnant women from Eden and Pélagie cohorts, from which phthalates and phenols metabolites levels were assayed. We applied a 2-step standardization method based on regression residuals. First, the influence of sampling conditions (including sampling hour, duration of storage before freezing) and of creatinine levels on biomarker concentrations were characterized using adjusted linear regression models. In the second step, the model estimates were used to remove the variability in biomarker concentrations due to sampling conditions and to standardize concentrations as if all samples had been collected under the same conditions (e.g., same hour of urine collection). Results: Sampling hour was associated with concentrations of several exposure biomarkers. After standardization for sampling conditions, median concentrations differed by - 38 \% for 2,5-dichlorophenol to +80 \% for a metabolite of diisodecyl phthalate. However, at the individual level, standardized biomarker levels were strongly correlated (correlation coefficients above 0.80) with unstandardized measures. Conclusions: Sampling conditions, such as sampling hour, should be systematically collected in biomarker-based studies, in particular when the biomarker half-life is short. The 2-step standardization method based on regression residuals that we proposed in order to limit the impact of heterogeneity in sampling conditions could be further tested in studies describing levels of biomarkers or their influence on health.},

Results showed that, for the homogeneous population (i.e., the population has k = 1 latent profile) conditions, many of the enumeration indexes used in LPA were able to correctly identify the single latent profile if variances and covariances were freely estimated. However, for a heterogeneous population (i.e., the population has k = 3 distinct latent profiles), the correct identification rate for the enumeration indexes in the k = 3 latent profile conditions was typically very low. These results are compared with the previous cross-sectional mixture modeling studies, and the limitations of this study, as well as future cross-sectional mixture modeling and enumeration index research possibilities, are discussed.},

DESIGN: Randomized assignment to one of three groups: a five day/week walking group (five-day group, n = 27);a three day/week walking group (three-day group, n = 27) or a sedentary group (control group, n = 25). SETTING: Community-based intervention. PARTICIPANTS: Women who were postmenopausal, over 50 years old, sedentary, not on hormone replacement therapy, nonsmokers, physically capable of exercising, without clinical signs of cardiovascular, pulmonary or metabolic disease, and not on medication that would affect iron metabolism. In addition, they had neither donated blood nor been transfused within the previous 12 months. All participants were screened volunteers who had responded to media advertisements. Seventy-nine participants met these criteria. Results are reported for 56 subjects (five-day group, n = 17; three-day group, n = 19; control group, n = 20) who completed the study. Their mean age was 61.3+/-5.8 years. INTERVENTION: The five-day group and the three-day group walked an average of 279+/-20 and 171+/-7 mins/week, respectively. Participants were counselled not to change their dietary intake. MAIN RESULTS: Following 24 weeks of walking, mean serum ferritin decreased significantly in the five-day group (P{$<$}0.03), but not in the three-day group (P{$<$}0.09) compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of physical activity required to elicit a decrease in stored iron in postmenopausal women was determined. This may be clinically significant because stored iron increases significantly following menopause and excess stored iron have been cited as risk factors for coronary artery disease.},

Latent class analysis and K-means clustering are popular methods for partitioning objects based on dichotomous measures in the psychological literature. The K-median clustering method has recently been touted as a potentially useful tool for psychological data and might be preferable to its close neighbor, K-means, when the variable measures are dichotomous. We conducted simulation-based comparisons of the latent class, K-means, and K-median approaches for partitioning dichotomous data. Although all 3 methods proved capable of recovering cluster structure, K-median clustering yielded the best average performance, followed closely by latent class analysis. We also report results for the 3 methods within the context of an application to transitive reasoning data, in which it was found that the 3 approaches can exhibit profound differences when applied to real data.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although conventionally managed as separate disease processes, recent research has lent insight into compelling commonalities between CVD and cancer, including shared mechanisms for disease development and progression. In this review, the authors discuss several pathophysiological processes common to both CVD and cancer, such as inflammation, resistance to cell death, cellular proliferation, neurohormonal stress, angiogenesis, and genomic instability, in an effort to understand common mechanisms of both disease states. In particular, the authors highlight key circulating and genomic biomarkers associated with each of these processes, as well as their associations with risk and prognosis in both cancer and CVD. The purpose of this state-of-the-art review is to further our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying cancer and CVD by contextualizing pathways and biomarkers common to both diseases.

  abstract = {Objectives Serum iron is an important clinical test to help identify cases of iron deficiency or overload. Fluctuations caused by diurnal variation and diet are thought to influence test results, which may affect clinical patient management. We examined the impact of these preanalytical factors on iron concentrations in a large community-based cohort. Design and Methods Serum iron concentration, blood collection time, fasting duration, patient age and sex were obtained for community-based clinical testing from the Laboratory Information Service at Calgary Laboratory Services for the period of January 2011 to December 2015. Results A total of 276,307 individual test results were obtained. Iron levels were relatively high over a long period from 8:00 to 15:00. Mean concentrations were highest at blood collection times of 11:00 for adult men and 12:00 for adult women and children, however iron levels peaked as late as 15:00 in teenagers. With regard to fasting, iron levels required approximately 5h post-prandial time to return to a baseline, except for children and teenage females where no significant variation was seen until after 11h fasting. After 10h fasting, iron concentrations in all patient groups gradually increased to higher levels compared to earlier fasting times. Conclusions Serum iron concentrations remain reasonably stable during most daytime hours for testing purposes. In adults, blood collection after 5 to 9h fasting provides a representative estimate of a patient's iron levels. For patients who have fasted overnight, i.e. ≥12h fasting, clinicians should be aware that iron concentrations may be elevated beyond otherwise usual levels.},

  abstract = {Background Individuals with obesity do not represent a homogeneous group in terms of cardiometabolic risk. Using 3 nationally representative British birth cohorts, we investigated whether the duration of obesity was related to heterogeneity in cardiometabolic risk. Methods and findings We used harmonised body mass index (BMI) and cardiometabolic disease risk factor data from 20,746 participants (49.1\% male and 97.2\% white British) enrolled in 3 British birth cohort studies: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS), and the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). Within each cohort, individual life course BMI trajectories were created between 10 and 40 years of age, and from these, age of obesity onset, duration spent obese (range 0 to 30 years), and cumulative obesity severity were derived. Obesity duration was examined in relation to a number of cardiometabolic disease risk factors collected in mid-adulthood: systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). A greater obesity duration was associated with worse values for all cardiometabolic disease risk factors. The strongest association with obesity duration was for HbA1c: HbA1c levels in those with obesity for {$<$}5 years were relatively higher by 5\% (95\% CI: 4, 6), compared with never obese, increasing to 20\% (95\% CI: 17, 23) higher in those with obesity for 20 to 30 years. When adjustment was made for obesity severity, the association with obesity duration was largely attenuated for SBP, DBP, and HDL-C. For HbA1c, however, the association with obesity duration persisted, independent of obesity severity. Due to pooling of 3 cohorts and thus the availability of only a limited number harmonised variables across cohorts, our models included adjustment for only a small number of potential confounding variables, meaning there is a possibility of residual confounding. Conclusions Given that the obesity epidemic is characterised by a much earlier onset of obesity and consequently a greater lifetime exposure, our findings suggest that health policy recommendations aimed at preventing early obesity onset, and therefore reducing lifetime exposure, may help reduce the risk of diabetes, independently of obesity severity. However, to test the robustness of our observed associations, triangulation of evidence from different epidemiological approaches (e.g., mendelian randomization and negative control studies) should be obtained.},

Objectives To identify and characterise distinct groups of children displaying similar early-life weight trajectories. Methods A growth mixture model captured heterogeneity in weight trajectories between 0 and 60 months in 1390 children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Differences between the classes in characteristics and body size/composition at 9 years were investigated. Results The best model had five classes. The “Normal” (45\%) and “Normal after initial catch-down” (24\%) classes were close to the 50th centile of a growth standard between 24 and 60 months. The “High-decreasing” (21\%) and “Stable-high” (7\%) classes peaked at the 91st centile at 12-18 months, but while the former declined to the 75th centile and comprised constitutionally big children, the latter did not. The “Rapidly increasing” (3\%) class gained weight from below the 50th centile at 4 months to above the 91st centile at 60 months. By 9 years, their mean body mass index (BMI) placed them at the 98th centile. This class was characterised by the highest maternal BMI; highest parity; highest levels of gestational hypertension and diabetes; and the lowest socio-economic position. At 9 years, the “Rapidly increasing” class was estimated to have 68.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 48.3, 88.1) more fat mass than the “Normal” class, but only 14.0\% (95\% CI 9.1, 18.9) more lean mass. Conclusions Criteria used in growth monitoring practice are unlikely to consistently distinguish between the different patterns of weight gain reported here.},

Methods: This prospective case-control study was comprised of 40 CAD patients and 40 healthy volunteers as cases and control subjects, respectively. The level of lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring the serum MDA level using a UV spectrophotometer. The levels of vitamins A and C were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UV spectrophotometric method, respectively. Atomic absorption spectros­ copy (AAS) was used to measure serum macro-minerals (Mg and Ca) and trace elements (Zn, Cu, and Fe) concentrations. Results: The mean age of CAD patients and control subjects was 53.90 ± 2.22 and 37.03 ± 1.50 years, respec­ tively. This study revealed significantly higher concentrations of MDA (p {$<$} 0.01) and lower concentrations of vitamin A (p {$<$} 0.01), and vitamin C (p {$<$} 0.05) in the CAD patients than in control subjects. The mean values of Mg, Cu, Zn, Ca, and Fe were 11.67 ± 0.64, 1.17 ± 0.03, 0.43 ± 0.02, 107.38 ± 1.81, and 1.66 ± 0.04 μg/mL, respectively for the CAD patients and 19.38 ± 0.65, 1.07 ± 0.02, 0.87 ± 0.02, 94.29 ± 1.89, and 1.52 ± 0.05 μg/ mL, respectively for the controls and the differences were significant (p {$<$} 0.05) between the patients and controls. Conclusion: From these findings, we can suggest that there is a strong association of CAD with an elevated level of MDA, depleted levels of antioxidants, and altered macro-minerals and trace elements concentrations.},

  abstract = {In pregnancy, changes in maternal calcium (Ca) economy occur to satisfy fetal Ca demand. It is unclear whether maternal mineral reserves facilitate these requirements and no data exist from sub-Saharan Africa. The aim was to determine skeletal changes with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and bone biochemistry between early second and third trimesters. Pregnant rural Gambians aged 18 to 45 years (n = 467) participating in a trial of antenatal nutritional supplements (ISRCTN49285450) had pQCT scans and blood collections at mean (SD) 14 (3) and 31 (1) weeks’ gestation. Outcomes were pQCT: radius/tibia 4\% total volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), trabecular vBMD, total cross-sectional area (CSA), 33\%/38\% radius/tibia cortical vBMD, bone mineral content (BMC), total CSA; biochemistry: collagen type 1 cross-linked β-C-telopeptide (β-CTX), type 1 procollagen N-terminal (P1NP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 1,25(OH)2D. Independent t tests tested whether pooled or within-group changes differed from 0. Multiple regression was performed adjusting for age. Data for change are expressed as mean (confidence interval [CI] 2.5, 97.5\%). Radius trabecular vBMD, cortical vBMD, and BMC increased by 1.15 (0.55, 1.75)\%, 0.41 (0.24, 0.58)\%, and 0.47 (0.25, 0.69)\%. Tibia total and trabecular vBMD increased by 0.34 (0.15, 0.54)\% and 0.46 (0.17, 0.74)\%, while tibia cortical vBMD, BMC, and cortical CSA increased by 0.35 (0.26, 0.44)\%, 0.55 (0.41, 0.68)\% and 0.20 (0.09, 0.31)\%, respectively. CTX, PTH, and 1,25(OH)2D increased by 23.0 (15.09, 29.29)\%, 13.2 (8.44, 19.34)\%, and 21.0 (17.67, 24.29)\%, while P1NP decreased by 32.4 (−37.19, −28.17)\%. No evidence of mobilization was observed in the peripheral skeleton. Resorption, although higher in late versus early gestation, was lower throughout pregnancy compared with non-pregnant non-lactating (NPNL) in the same community. Formation was lower in late pregnancy than in early, and below NPNL levels. This suggests a shift in the ratio of resorption to formation. Despite some evidence of change in bone metabolism, in this population, with habitually low Ca intakes, the peripheral skeleton was not mobilized as a Ca source for the fetus. © 2021 crown copyright .

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D is an environmental and dietary agent with known anticarcinogenic effects, but protection against breast cancer has not been established. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, supplemental vitamin D use, and breast cancer incidence over the subsequent 5 y of follow-up. METHODS: From 2003–2009, the Sister Study enrolled 50,884 U.S. women 35–74 y old who had a sister with breast cancer but had never had breast cancer themselves. Using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, we measured 25(OH)D in serum samples from 1,611 women who later developed breast cancer and from 1,843 randomly selected cohort participants. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of developing breast cancer using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: We found that 25(OH)D levels {$>$}38:0 ng=mL were associated with a 21\% lower breast cancer hazard (highest versus lowest quartile: adjusted HR = 0:79; CI: 0.63, 0.98). Analysis of the first 5 y of follow-up for all 50,884 Sister Study participants showed that self-reported vitamin D supplementation ≥4 times=wk was associated with an 11\% lower hazard [HR = 0:89 (CI: 0.81, 0.99)]. These associations were particularly strong among postmenopausal women [HR = 0:72 (CI: 0.57, 0.93) and HR = 0:83 (CI: 0.74, 0.93), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of women with elevated risk, high serum 25(OH)D levels and regular vitamin D supplement use were associated with lower rates of incident, postmenopausal breast cancer over 5 y of follow-up. These results may help to establish clinical benchmarks for 25(OH)D levels; in addition, they support the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation is useful in breast cancer prevention. https://doi.org/10.1289/ EHP943},

The authors compared the results of a meta-analysis of published data using each of the 2 methods with the results that would be obtained if the primary data were available and investigated the circumstances under which the approximations required for valid use of each meta-analytic method break down. They then extended the methods to handle nonlinear exposure-response relations. In the present article, methods are illustrated using studies of the relation between alcohol consumption and colorectal and lung cancer risks from the ongoing Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer. In these examples, the differences between the results of a meta-analysis of summarized published data and the pooled analysis of the individual original data were small. However, incorrectly assuming no correlation between relative risk estimates for exposure categories from the same study gave biased confidence intervals for the trend and biased P values for the tests for nonlinearity and between-study heterogeneity when there was strong confounding by other model covariates. The authors illustrate the use of 2 publicly available user-friendly programs (Stata and SAS) to implement meta-analysis for dose-response data.},

Here, we evaluated prediagnostic serum concentrations of ferritin, iron and transferrin as well as transferrin saturation (TSAT) in relation to cancer risk and mortality in a prospective study by multivariable Cox regression analyses. A case-cohort sample of the population-based EPIC-Heidelberg Study including a random subcohort (n=2738) and incident cases of breast cancer (n=627), prostate cancer (n=554), lung cancer (n=195), colorectal cancer (n=256) and cancer death (n=759) was used. Ferritin levels were inversely associated with breast cancer risk in the multivariable Cox regression model, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 [95\% confidence interval: 0.49, 0.92] for women in the highest quartile compared to those in the lowest quartile. Neither ferritin nor the other markers of iron status were significantly associated with colorectal, prostate or lung cancer risk. An inverse association was observed between ferritin and total cancer mortality (HR: 0.70 [0.53, 0.92]). There were no significant overall associations between serum iron, transferrin or TSAT and cancer mortality. The present findings do not support the notion of increased iron load constituting a cancer risk factor in the general population. By contrast, our analyses revealed inverse associations between ferritin levels and breast cancer risk as well as cancer mortality. What's new? While experimental evidence suggests carcinogenic effects of increased iron load, there is a lack of data on iron status and cancer risk from epidemiological studies. Here, the authors evaluated associations between prediagnostic serum levels of ferritin, serum iron, transferrin and transferrin saturation and the risk of common cancers using a large case-cohort sample. The established biomarkers of iron status were not associated with increased cancer risk. By contrast, higher serum ferritin was related to lower risks of breast cancer and cancer mortality. The findings suggest that higher iron load does not constitute a cancer risk factor in the general population.},

How to utilize the available case-cohort data to study the relationship of a secondary outcome with the primary exposure obtained through the case-cohort study is not well studied. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric estimated likelihood approach for analyzing a secondary outcome in a case-cohort study. The estimation is based on maximizing a semiparametric likelihood function that is built jointly on both time-to-failure outcome and the secondary outcome. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent, efficient, and asymptotically normal. Finite sample performance is evaluated via simulation studies.

For a study with continuous primary outcome, an ODS scheme can be implemented where the expensive exposure is only measured on a simple random sample and supplemental samples selected from 2 tails of the primary outcome variable. With the tremendous cost invested in collecting the primary exposure information, investigators often would like to use the available data to study the relationship between a secondary outcome and the obtained exposure variable. This is referred as secondary analysis. Secondary analysis in ODS designs can be tricky, as the ODS sample is not a random sample from the general population. In this article, we use the inverse probability weighted and augmented inverse probability weighted estimating equations to analyze the secondary outcome for data obtained from the ODS design. We do not make any parametric assumptions on the primary and secondary outcome and only specify the form of the regression mean models, thus allow an arbitrary error distribution. Our approach is robust to second- and higher-order moment misspecification. It also leads to more precise estimates of the parameters by effectively using all the available participants. Through simulation studies, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project are analyzed to illustrate our method.},

High E-DII score and low D-OBS represent a more proinflammatory and prooxidant diet, respectively, and associations of quartiles of each index with breast cancer (BC) risk were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. There were 2619 BCs diagnosed at least 1 year after enrollment (mean follow-up 8.4 years). There was no overall association between E-DII and BC risk, whereas there was a suggestive inverse association for the highest vs lowest quartile of D-OBS (HR 0.92 [95\% CI, 0.81-1.03]). The highest quartile of E-DII was associated with risk of triple-negative BC (HR 1.53 [95\% CI, 0.99-2.35]). When the two indices were combined, a proinflammatory/prooxidant diet (highest tertile of E-DII and lowest tertile of D-OBS) was associated with increased risk for all BC (HR 1.13 [95\% CI, 1.00-1.27]) and for triple-negative BC (1.72 [95\% CI, 1.10-2.70]), compared to an antiinflammatory/antioxidant diet (lowest tertile of E-DII and highest tertile of D-OBS). Diets with increased inflammatory potential and reduced oxidative balance were positively associated with overall and triple-negative BC.},

  abstract = {Background: Blood donation results in a loss of iron stores, which is particularly concerning for young female blood donors. This study examines the association of blood donation and iron deficiency among adolescent and adult females in the United States. Study design and methods: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using data from the 1999–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Females who reported their blood donation history in the preceding year and had serum ferritin (SF) measurements were included. Analyses were weighted and stratified by adolescents (16–19 years;n=2,419) and adults (20–49 years;n=7,228). Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) were estimated by multivariable Poisson regression. Standard errors were estimated by Taylor series linearization. Results: Geometric mean SF levels (ng/mL) were lower in blood donors compared to non-donors among adolescents (21.2 vs. 31.4;p{$<$}0.001) and among adults (26.2 vs. 43.7;p{$<$}0.001). The prevalence of absent iron stores (SF{$<$}12 ng/mL) was higher in blood donors compared to non-donors among adolescents (22.6\% vs. 12.2\%; aPR=2.03 [95\%CI=1.45–2.85]) and among adults (18.3\% vs. 9.8\%; aPR=2.06 [95\%CI=1.48–2.88]). Additionally, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia (SF{$<$}26 ng/mL and hemoglobin{$<$}12.0 g/dL) was also higher in blood donors compared to non-donors among adolescents (9.5\% vs. 6.1\%; aPR=2.10 [95\%CI=1.13–3.90]) and among adults (7.9\% vs. 6.1\%; aPR=1.74 [95\%CI=1.06–2.85]). Similar results were observed in a sensitivity analysis restricted to adolescents aged 16–18 years. Conclusions: Blood donation is associated with iron deficiency among adolescent and adult females in the U.S. These national data call for further development and implementation of blood donation practices aimed toward mitigating iron deficiency.},

However, matching in a case-control study does not control for confounding by the matching factors; in fact it can introduce confounding by the matching factors even when it did not exist in the source population. Thus, a matched design may require controlling for the matching factors in the analysis. However, it is not the case that a matched design requires a matched analysis. Provided that there are no problems of sparse data, control for the matching factors can be obtained, with no loss of validity and a possible increase in precision, using a “standard” (unconditional) analysis, and a “matched” (conditional) analysis may not be required or appropriate.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {One of the benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is to decrease cardiovascular disease. A mechanism whereby HRT may play a role in reducing cardiovascular risk is through improved iron status parameters. High serum ferritin has been related to increased risk of coronary heart disease, whereas low iron-binding capacity has been identified as an important risk factor for myocardial infarction. This study examined iron status parameters in a group of postmenopausal women taking oral HRT (n = 27) and those not taking oral HRT (n = 27) at two times 1 year apart. Women were compared on the following serum measures: estradiol, lipids, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin. Women taking HRT had higher levels of estradiol (p {$<$} 0.001) and improved lipid profiles (p {$<$} 0.001) (lower total and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol). In addition, women on HRT had better iron status parameters than those not on HRT (p = 0.002). Total iron-binding capacity was greater for women on HRT compared with women not on HRT, and serum ferritin levels were lower in women on HRT than those not on HRT. The groups were comparable in age, body mass index, and physical activity. Our results confirm previous findings and indicate that women taking HRT have higher serum levels of estradiol and improved lipid profiles compared with those not taking HRT. In addition, we have found that iron status parameters are better in women taking HRT, suggesting the need to further examine this effect as it relates to decreased cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women.},

  abstract = {Iron (Fe) is an essential element that plays a fundamental role in a wide range of cellular functions, including cellular proliferation, DNA synthesis, as well as DNA damage and repair. Because of these connections, iron has been strongly implicated in cancer development. Cancer cells frequently have changes in the expression of iron regulatory proteins. For example, cancer cells frequently upregulate transferrin (increasing uptake of iron) and down regulate ferroportin (decreasing efflux of intracellular iron). These changes increase the steady-state level of intracellular redox active iron, known as the labile iron pool (LIP). The LIP typically contains approximately 2\% intracellular iron, which primarily exists as ferrous iron (Fe2+). The LIP can readily contribute to oxidative distress within the cell through Fe2+-dioxygen and Fenton chemistries, generating the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (HO\&bull;). Due to the reactive nature of the LIP, it can contribute to increased DNA damage. Mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer cells results in increased steady-state levels of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide along with other downstream reactive oxygen species. The increased presence of H2O2 and O2\&bull;\&minus; can increase the LIP, contributing to increased mitochondrial uptake of iron as well as genetic instability. Thus, iron metabolism and labile iron pools may play a central role connecting the genetic mutational theories of cancer to the metabolic theories of cancer.},

  abstract = {Biochemical assessment of iron status relies on serum-based indicators, such as serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), as well as erythrocyte protoporphyrin. These indicators present challenges for clinical practice and national nutrition surveys, and often iron status interpretation is based on the combination of several indicators. The diagnosis of iron deficiency (ID) through SF concentration, the most commonly used indicator, is complicated by concomitant inflammation. sTfR concentration is an indicator of functional ID that is not an acute-phase reactant, but challenges in its interpretation arise because of the lack of assay standardization, common reference ranges, and common cutoffs. It is unclear which indicators are best suited to assess excess iron status. The value of hepcidin, non–transferrin-bound iron, and reticulocyte indexes is being explored in research settings. Serum-based indicators are generally measured on fully automated clinical analyzers available in most hospitals. Although international reference materials have been available for years, the standardization of immunoassays is complicated by the heterogeneity of antibodies used and the absence of physicochemical reference methods to establish “true” concentrations. From 1988 to 2006, the assessment of iron status in NHANES was based on the multi-indicator ferritin model. However, the model did not indicate the severity of ID and produced categorical estimates. More recently, iron status assessment in NHANES has used the total body iron stores (TBI) model, in which the log ratio of sTfR to SF is assessed. Together, sTfR and SF concentrations cover the full range of iron status. The TBI model better predicts the absence of bone marrow iron than SF concentration alone, and TBI can be analyzed as a continuous variable. Additional consideration of methodologies, interpretation of indicators, and analytic standardization is important for further improvements in iron status assessment.},

  abstract = {Iron metabolism and tumor biology are intimately linked. Iron facilitates the production of oxygen radicals, which may either result in iron-induced cell death, ferroptosis, or contribute to mutagenicity and malignant transformation. Once transformed, malignant cells require high amounts of iron for proliferation. In addition, iron has multiple regulatory effects on the immune system, thus affecting tumor surveillance by immune cells. For these reasons, inconsiderate iron supplementation in cancer patients has the potential of worsening disease course and outcome. On the other hand, chronic immune activation in the setting of malignancy alters systemic iron homeostasis and directs iron fluxes into myeloid cells. While this response aims at withdrawing iron from tumor cells, it may impair the effector functions of tumor-associated macrophages and will result in iron-restricted erythropoiesis and the development of anemia, subsequently. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the interconnections of iron homeostasis with cancer biology, discusses current clinical controversies in the treatment of anemia of cancer and focuses on the potential roles of iron in the solid tumor microenvironment, also speculating on yet unknown molecular mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Unprecedented technological growth in the last quarter of twentieth century has resulted in improved health care and opened new domains of health care research. This technological leap also facilitated the paradigm shift from hospital care to home care through development of ‘point of care’ devices. As early diagnoses and timely referral is a key to health management, these devices play an important role in improving health. Validation of the new technology in different settings is necessary before adopting it to practice. For a binary result like pregnancy test, it is trivial to use statistical tools like sensitivity, specificity etc. For a continuous variable like blood glucose level the analysis is not straightforward. Many of us misinterpret ‘association’ as ‘agreement’. This misinterpretation is reflected in studies which have compared two different technologies. The findings of well conducted studies do not contribute to the evidence base just because of wrong analysis strategy. We delineate on finer nuances of analysis and interpretation of method comparison studies.},

  abstract = {Oxidative stress arises when there is a marked imbalance between the production and removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in favor of the prooxidant balance, leading to potential oxidative damage. ROSs were considered traditionally to be only a toxic byproduct of aerobic metabolism. However, recently, it has become apparent that ROS might control many different physiological processes such as induction of stress response, pathogen defense, and systemic signaling. Thus, the imbalance of the increased antioxidant potential, the so-called antioxidative stress, should be as dangerous as well. Here, we synthesize increasing evidence on "antioxidative stress-induced" beneficial versus harmful roles on health, disease, and aging processes. Oxidative stress is not necessarily an un-wanted situation, since its consequences may be beneficial for many physiological reactions in cells. On the other hand, there are potentially harmful effects of "antioxidative stress," especially in the cases of overconsumption of synthetic antioxidants. Antioxidants can neutralize ROS and decrease oxidative stress; however, this is not always beneficial in regard to disease formation or progression (of, e.g., cancer) or for delaying aging.},

The role of iron deficiency (ID) in heart failure (HF) has been a subject of debate amid increasing advocacy for intravenous (IV) supplementation. Both the definition and the approach to treatment of ID in HF have been adapted from the experience in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this review, we highlight the differences in regulatory mechanisms as well as pathophysiology of ID in CKD and HF population both at the systemic and cellular levels. We will review the major clinical trials in HF patients that have shown symptomatic benefit from IV iron supplementation but without effect on clinical outcomes. Intravenous iron loading bypasses the mechanisms that tightly regulate iron uptake and can potentially cause myocardial and endothelial damage by releasing reactive oxygen species. By contrast, newer oral iron preparations do not have similar toxicity concerns and might have a role in heart failure.},

A case-cohort sample of the population-based EPIC-Heidelberg Study including a random subcohort (n\,=\,2738) and incident cases of breast cancer (n\,=\,627), prostate cancer (n\,=\,554), lung cancer (n\,=\,195), colorectal cancer (n\,=\,256) and cancer death (n\,=\,759) was used. Ferritin levels were inversely associated with breast cancer risk in the multivariable Cox regression model, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 [95\% confidence interval: 0.49, 0.92] for women in the highest quartile compared to those in the lowest quartile. Neither ferritin nor the other markers of iron status were significantly associated with colorectal, prostate or lung cancer risk. An inverse association was observed between ferritin and total cancer mortality (HR: 0.70 [0.53, 0.92]). There were no significant overall associations between serum iron, transferrin or TSAT and cancer mortality. The present findings do not support the notion of increased iron load constituting a cancer risk factor in the general population.

Methods: This study monitored the levels of two heavy metals (Al and Pb), and seven trace elements (Macro­ elements Mg, K, P and Ca; Microelements Zn, Cu, Fe) in scalp hair of 57 children with severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 50 age-matched controls, using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectropho­ tometry (ICP-AES). Results: Compared to controls, significantly higher levels of Al (p = 0.001), Pb (p = 0.001) and K (p = 0.021), with lower levels of Mg and Zn (p = 0.038) were observed for the ASD group. ASD boys had higher levels of Al (p = 0.001), Pb (p = 0.001) and K (p = 0.017) than control boys, while ASD girls had higher Pb levels (p = 0.005) than control girls. The ASD subgroup exposed to passive smokers had higher levels of Al (p = 0.033) and Pb (p = 0.001, and the ASD subgroup not exposed to passive smoke had higher levels of Al (p = 0.011), Pb (p = 0.001), K (p = 0.003); and lower levels of Mg (p = 0.011) than their controls. Other confounding factors and the correlation between these elements were also investigated. Conclusion: This data suggests that exposure to Al and Pb, increase intake of K, and decreased intake of mag­ nesium and zinc, may contribute to ASD etiology.},

  abstract = {Total iron intake is not strongly associated with iron stores, but haem iron intake may be more predictive. Haem iron is not available in most nutrient databases, so experimentally determined haem contents were applied to an Australian Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) to estimate haem iron intake in a representative sample of young women (25–30 years). The association between dietary haem iron intakes and incident self-reported diagnosed iron deficiency over six years of follow-up was examined. Haem iron contents for Australian red meats, fish, and poultry were applied to haem-containing foods in the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies V2 (DQESv2) FFQ. Haem iron intakes were calculated for 9076 women from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health (ALSWH) using the DQESv2 dietary data from 2003. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between haem iron intake (2003) and the incidence of iron deficiency in 2006 and 2009. Multiple logistic regression showed baseline haem iron intake was a statistically significant predictor of iron deficiency in 2006 (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.91; 95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.84–0.99; p-value: 0.020) and 2009 (OR: 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.82–0.99; p-value: 0.007). Using the energy-adjusted haem intake made little difference to the associations. Higher haem iron intake is associated with reduced odds of iron deficiency developing in young adult Australian women.},

  abstract = {Background Dietary studies show a relationship between the intake of iron enhancers and inhibitors and iron stores in the general population. However, the impact of dietary factors on the iron stores of blood donors, whose iron status is affected by blood donations, is incompletely understood. Study Design and Methods In the Danish Blood Donor Study, we assessed the effect of blood donation frequency, physiologic factors, lifestyle and supplemental factors, and dietary factors on ferritin levels. We used multiple linear and logistic regression analyses stratified by sex and menopausal status. Results Among high-frequency donors (more than nine donations in the past 3\,years), we found iron deficiency (ferritin below 15\,ng/mL) in 9, 39, and 22\% of men, premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women, respectively. The strongest predictors of iron deficiency were sex, menopausal status, the number of blood donations in a 3-year period, and the time since last donation. Other significant factors included weight, age, intensity of menstruation, iron tablets, vitamin pills, and consumption of meat and wine. Conclusion The study confirms iron deficiency as an important problem, especially among menstruating women donating frequently. The risk of iron depletion was largely explained by sex, menopausal status, and donation frequency. Other factors, including dietary and supplemental iron intake, had a much weaker effect on the risk of iron depletion.},

  abstract = {The maintenance of stable extracellular and intracellular iron concentrations requires the coordinated regulation of iron transport into plasma. Iron is a fundamental cofactor for several enzymes involved in oxidation–reduction reactions. The redox ability of iron can lead to the production of oxygen free radicals, which can damage various cellular components. Therefore, the appropriate regulation of systemic iron homeostasis is decisive in vital processes. Hepcidin has emerged as the central regulatory molecule of systemic iron homeostasis. It is synthesized in hepatocytes and in other cells and released into the circulation. It inhibits the release of iron from enterocytes of the duodenum and from macrophages by binding to the iron exporter protein, ferroportin (FPN). FPN is a transmembrane protein responsible for iron export from cells into the plasma. Hepcidin is internalized with FPN and both are degraded in lysosomes. The hepcidin–FPN axis is the principal regulator of extracellular iron homeostasis in health and disease. Its manipulation via agonists and antagonists is an attractive and novel therapeutic strategy. Hepcidin agonists include compounds that mimic the activity of hepcidin and agents that increase the production of hepcidin by targeting hepcidin-regulatory molecules. The inhibition of hepcidin could be a potentially attractive therapeutic strategy in patients suffering from anaemia or chronic inflammation. In this review, we will summarize the role of hepcidin in iron homeostasis and its contribution to the pathophysiology of inflammation and iron disorders. We will examine emerging new strategies that modulate hepcidin metabolism.},

  abstract = {Maintenance of iron homeostasis is critical to cellular health as both its excess and insufficiency are detrimental. Likewise, lipids, which are essential components of cellular membranes and signaling mediators, must also be tightly regulated to hinder disease progression. Recent research, using a myriad of model organisms, as well as data from clinical studies, has revealed links between these two metabolic pathways, but the mechanisms behind these interactions and the role these have in the progression of human diseases remains unclear. In this review, we summarize literature describing cross-talk between iron and lipid pathways, including alterations in cholesterol, sphingolipid, and lipid droplet metabolism in response to changes in iron levels. We discuss human diseases correlating with both iron and lipid alterations, including neurodegenerative disorders, and the available evidence regarding the potential mechanisms underlying how iron may promote disease pathogenesis. Finally, we review research regarding iron reduction techniques and their therapeutic potential in treating patients with these debilitating conditions. We propose that iron-mediated alterations in lipid metabolic pathways are involved in the progression of these diseases, but further research is direly needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved.},

  abstract = {Objective: To assess and quantify the association between processed meat consumption and cancers of the breast, endometrium, ovary, and prostate. Methods: Data were derived from an integrated network of hospital-based case-control studies conducted between 1982 and 2006 in various Italian areas. These studies included 5981 cases of cancer of the breast, 992 of the endometrium, 2002 of the ovary, 1582 of the prostate, and a total of 16 394 controls with data on processed meat. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by unconditional multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for major recognized confounders for each cancer site. Results: The median consumption of processed meat in this population was 2 portions per wk in each cancer-specific cases, controls, and overall, corresponding to 100 g/wk. The OR for the highest (≥20 g/d) compared with lowest ({$<$}10 g/d) category of processed meat consumption was 1.16 (95\% CI 1.06–1.28) for breast, 1.31 (95\% CI 1.07–1.60) for endometrial, 1.49 (95\% CI 1.30–1.71) for ovarian, and 0.89 (95\% CI 0.74–1.07) for prostate cancer. Conclusion: In this case-control study, we found some excess risks of high processed meat consumption with female hormone-related cancers. Conversely, no association with prostate cancer was found in men. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Iron is an essential nutrient that facilitates cell proliferation and growth. However, iron also has the capacity to engage in redox cycling and free radical formation. Therefore, iron can contribute to both tumour initiation and tumour growth; recent work has also shown that iron has a role in the tumour microenvironment and in metastasis. Pathways of iron acquisition, efflux, storage and regulation are all perturbed in cancer, suggesting that reprogramming of iron metabolism is a central aspect of tumour cell survival. Signalling through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and WNT pathways may contribute to altered iron metabolism in cancer. Targeting iron metabolic pathways may provide new tools for cancer prognosis and therapy.},

  abstract = {The importance of iron in the growth and progression of tumors has been widely documented. In this report, we show that tumor-initiating cells (TICs), represented by spheres derived from the MCF7 cell line, exhibit higher intracellular labile iron pool, mitochondrial iron accumulation and are more susceptible to iron chelation. TICs also show activation of the IRP/IRE system, leading to higher iron uptake and decrease in iron storage, suggesting that level of properly assembled cytosolic iron-sulfur clusters (FeS) is reduced. This finding is confirmed by lower enzymatic activity of aconitase and FeS cluster biogenesis enzymes, as well as lower levels of reduced glutathione, implying reduced FeS clusters synthesis/utilization in TICs. Importantly, we have identified specific gene signature related to iron metabolism consisting of genes regulating iron uptake, mitochondrial FeS cluster biogenesis and hypoxic response (ABCB10, ACO1, CYBRD1, EPAS1, GLRX5, HEPH, HFE, IREB2, QSOX1 and TFRC). Principal component analysis based on this signature is able to distinguish TICs from cancer cells in vitro and also Leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) from non-LICs in the mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Majority of the described changes were also recapitulated in an alternative model represented by MCF7 cells resistant to tamoxifen (TAMR) that exhibit features of TICs. Our findings point to the critical importance of redox balance and iron metabolism-related genes and proteins in the context of cancer and TICs that could be potentially used for cancer diagnostics or therapy.},

Differences in hair iron concentration were evaluated between the groups. Correlation analysis was applied to define the association between the laboratory values used as markers of body iron content and hair iron concentration. A statistically significant difference was determined in hair iron Fe-56 and Fe-57 concentrations between the group with transfusion-related anaemia, the iron deficiency anaemia group and the healthy control group (P{$<$}0.001). In addition, a positive correlation was determined between hair iron Fe-56 and Fe-57 concentrations and serum iron, ferritin level, transferrin saturation, mean erythrocyte volume and mean erythrocyte haemoglobin values and a negative correlation with TIBC. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed a statistically significant difference in the hair iron concentrations of the patient groups with different body iron content and these values were correlated to the laboratory markers of body iron content.},

  abstract = {Objective Dried blood spot (DBS) methodology offers significant advantages over venipuncture in vulnerable populations or large-scale studies, including reduced participant burden and higher response rates. Uncertainty about validity of cardiovascular risk biomarkers remains a barrier to wide-scale use. We determined the validity of DBS-derived biomarkers of CVD risk versus gold-standard assessments, and study-specific, serum-equivalency values for clinical relevance of DBS-derived values. Methods Concurrent venipuncture serum and DBS samples (n=150 adults) were assayed in CLIA-certified and DBS laboratories, respectively. Time controls of DBS standard samples were assayed single-blind along with test samples. Linear regression analyses evaluated DBS-to-serum equivalency values; agreement and bias were assessed via Bland-Altman plots. Results Linear regressions of venipuncture values on DBS-to-serum equivalencies provided R2 values for TC, HDL-C, CRP of 0.484, 0.118, 0.666, respectively. Bland-Altman plots revealed minimal systematic bias between DBS-to-serum and venipuncture values; precision worsened at higher mean values of CRP. Time controls reveal little degradation or change in analyte values for HDL-C and CRP over 30 weeks. Conclusions DBS-assessed biomarkers represent a valid alternative to venipuncture assessments. Large studies using DBS should include study-specific serum-equivalency determinations to optimize individual-level sensitivity, viability of detecting intervention effects, and generalizability in community-level, primary prevention interventions.},

  abstract = {Oxidative stress (OS) is the imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant molecules, in favor of oxidants, that causes aging and disease. Many studies have been published that demonstrate the relationship between OS and human health and disease; however, the following questions arise: (i) how are we sure that the OS is present in a biological process? (ii) Is the OS reported in the different investigations equivalent? (iii) What are the best oxidant and antioxidant markers for OS diagnosis? (iv) Can we establish the types and the intensity of the OS? (v) Does OS index could be useful for research and/or application in clinical medicine? In this regard, several indexes have been proposed to measure OS in humans relative to the state of health and disease, among which the following can be highlighted: Oxidative Stress Index (OSI), Tiol Ratios (-SH/TT, -SS/-SH, and-SS/TT), Glutathione Ratio (GSSG/GSH), Oxidative Stress Score (OSS), and OXY-index. Therefore, the aim of this review is to present the state of the art of knowledge about OS indexes for diagnosis of health or disease in humans. We searched for articles in English or Spanish in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus electronic databases published up until May 2019. The keywords used were “oxidative stress,” “index,” and “oxidative stress index.” It was identified 11479 records in both databases, and 490 articles were analyzed. Our review suggests that all indexes analyzed allow diagnose and differentiate the OS related to human health and disease. Also, the studies on OSI, Oxy-score, and OSS indexes have proven to be reliable, practical, and with clinical utility. However, it is necessary to continue with longitudinal studies, especially assess the usefulness of the indexes in the clinical prognosis, and make comparative studies between the different indexes.},

OBJECTIVE: The Sister Study sought a large cohort of women never diagnosed with breast cancer but who had a sister (full or half) diagnosed with breast cancer. METHODS: A multifaceted national effort employed novel strategies to recruit a diverse cohort, and collected biological and environmental samples and extensive data on potential breast cancer risk factors. RESULTS: The Sister Study enrolled 50,884 U.S. and Puerto Rican women 35-74y of age (median 56 y). Although the majority were non-Hispanic white, well educated, and economically well off, substantial numbers of harder-to-recruit women also enrolled (race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white: 16\%; no college degree: 35\%; household income {$<\$$}50,000: 26\%). Although all had a biologic sister with breast cancer, 16.5\% had average or lower risk of breast cancer according to the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (Gail score). Most were postmenopausal (66\%), parous with a first full-term pregnancy {$<$}30y of age (79\%), never-smokers (56\%) with body mass indexes (BMIs) of {$<$}29.9\,kg/m2 (70\%). Few (5\%) reported any cancer prior to enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: The Sister Study is a unique cohort designed to efficiently study environmental and genetic risk factors for breast cancer. Extensive exposure data over the life-course and baseline specimens provide important opportunities for studying breast cancer and other health outcomes in women.

  abstract = {Despite decades of research to elucidate the cancer preventive mechanisms of aspirin and flavonoids, a consensus has not been reached on their specific modes of action. This inability to accurately pinpoint the mechanism involved is due to the failure to differentiate the primary targets from its associated downstream responses. This review is written in the context of the recent findings on the potential pathways involved in the prevention of colorectal cancers (CRC) by aspirin and flavonoids. Recent reports have demonstrated that the aspirin metabolites 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA) and the flavonoid metabolites 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid (2,4,6-THBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHBA) and 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4,5-THBA) were effective in inhibiting cancer cell growth in vitro. Limited in vivo studies also provide evidence that some of these hydroxybenzoic acids (HBAs) inhibit tumor growth in animal models. This raises the possibility that a common pathway involving HBAs may be responsible for the observed cancer preventive actions of aspirin and flavonoids. Since substantial amounts of aspirin and flavonoids are left unabsorbed in the intestinal lumen upon oral consumption, they may be subjected to degradation by the host and bacterial enzymes, generating simpler phenolic acids contributing to the prevention of CRC. Interestingly, these HBAs are also abundantly present in fruits and vegetables. Therefore, we suggest that the HBAs produced through microbial degradation of aspirin and flavonoids or those consumed through the diet may be common mediators of CRC prevention.},

  abstract = {Purpose Both blood and toenail selenium are used to assess selenium exposure in epidemiologic studies. Little is known about the relationship of these biomarkers with each other or about whether there are differences in the relationships of these biomarkers with diet, supplement use, or participant characteristics. Methods Data are from 220 participants in a large cohort study of supplement use and cancer risk. Measures of selenium exposure included supplement use (current and 10-year) from a self-administered questionnaire, an inventory of currently used supplements (multivitamins and single supplements), dietary intake from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and selenium concentration in toenails and plasma. Results Plasma and toenail selenium concentrations were significantly correlated (r=.56 [95\% confidence interval: .46, .64]). Supplemental selenium was the strongest predictor of both selenium biomarkers, and these associations were slightly stronger when based on the supplement inventory and 10-year self-reported use compared to current self-reported use. Correlations of current and 10-year questionnaire dose and inventory dose with toenail selenium were .26, .36, and .33; for plasma selenium, these were .27, .36, and .36. Neither dietary selenium nor any participant characteristics, except smoking, was related to either biomarker. Current smokers had lower toenail, but not plasma, selenium levels compared to nonsmokers (.89 versus 1.03μg/g, p = .03); however, the difference was not significant after control for supplement use (p = .09). Conclusions Both toenail and plasma selenium levels similarly reflect selenium intake exposure. There do not appear to be independent associations of toenail or plasma selenium with FFQ-derived selenium intakes, health-related behaviors, or demographic characteristics.},

Considering the pivotal role of macrophages for iron homeostasis and their association with poor clinical outcome, we investigated the role of macrophage-secreted iron for tumor progression by applying a novel chelation approach. We applied flow cytometry and multiplex-immunohistochemistry to detect iron-dependent markers and analyzed iron distribution with atomic absorption spectrometry in patients diagnosed with RCC. We further analyzed the functional significance of iron by applying a novel extracellular chelator using RCC cell lines as well as patient-derived primary cells. The expression of iron-regulated genes was significantly elevated in tumors compared to adjacent healthy tissue. Iron retention was detected in tumor cells, whereas tumor-associated macrophages showed an iron-release phenotype accompanied by enhanced expression of ferroportin. We found increased iron amounts in extracellular fluids, which in turn stimulated tumor cell proliferation and migration. In vitro, macrophage-derived iron showed pro-tumor functions, whereas application of an extracellular chelator blocked these effects. Our study provides new insights in iron distribution and iron-handling in RCC. Chelators that specifically scavenge iron in the extracellular space confirmed the importance of macrophage-secreted iron in promoting tumor growth.},

  abstract = {Aims/hypothesis Although family history of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a strong risk factor for the disease, the factors mediating this excess risk are poorly understood. In the InterAct case-cohort study we investigated the association of family history of diabetes among different family members with incidence of T2D and the extent to which genetic, anthropometric and lifestyle risk factors mediated this association. Methods 13,869 individuals (including 6,168 incident cases of T2D) had family history data available, and 6,887 individuals had complete data on all mediators. Country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox models were fitted within-country and hazard ratios (HR) combined using random-effects meta-analysis. Lifestyle and anthropometric measurements were performed at baseline and a genetic risk score comprising 35 T2D-associated polymorphisms was created. Results A family history was associated with higher incidence of T2D (HR:2.72(95\%CI:2.48-2.99)). Adjustment for established risk factors including BMI and waist-circumference only modestly attenuated this association (HR:2.44(95\%CI:2.03,2.95)); the genetic score alone explained only 2\% of the family history-associated risk of T2D. Greatest risk of T2D was observed in those with a biparental history of T2D (HR:5.14(95\%CI:3.74,7.07)) and those with parental diabetes diagnosis at younger age ({$<$}50yrs) (HR:4.69(95\%CI:3.35,6.58)) - an effect largely confined to maternal family history. Conclusions/interpretation Prominent lifestyle, anthropometric and genetic risk factors explained only a marginal proportion of the family history-associated excess risk, highlighting that family history remains a strong, independent and easily assessed risk factor for T2D. Discovering the factors explaining the association of family history with T2D risk will provide important insight into the aetiology of T2D.},

It is usually done when wanting to analyse the trend, and cyclical deviations from trend, of a time series independently of the seasonal components. Many economic phenomena have seasonal cycles, such as agricultural production, (crop yields fluctuate with the seasons) and consumer consumption (increased personal spending leading up to Christmas). It is necessary to adjust for this component in order to understand underlying trends in the economy, so official statistics are often adjusted to remove seasonal components. Typically, seasonally adjusted data is reported for unemployment rates to reveal the underlying trends and cycles in labor markets.},

One of the first research questions is to determine the correlation between two measures. The following five methods for correlation calculation are compared: (1) Pearson correlation; (2) correlation of subject means; (3) partial correlation for subject effect; (4) partial correlation for visit effect; and (5) a mixed model approach. Pearson correlation coefficient is traditionally used in a cross-sectional study. Pearson correlation is close to the correlations computed from mixed-effects models that consider the correlation structure, but Pearson correlation may not be theoretically appropriate in a repeated-measure study as it ignores the correlation of the outcomes from multiple visits within the same subject. We compare these methods with regard to the average of correlation and the mean squared error. In general, correlation under the mixed-effects model with the compound symmetric structure is recommended as its correlation is close to the nominal level with small mean square error.},

It also has the potential pitfall of reduced objectivity as it opens the possibility of selecting “favorable” model that yields strong treatment benefit estimate. Although there is a large volume of statistical literature targeting on the first aspect, realistic solutions to enforce objective inference and improve precision are rare. As a typical randomized trial needs to accommodate many implementation issues beyond statistical considerations, maintaining the objectivity is at least as important as precision gain if not more, particularly from the perspective of the regulatory agencies. In this article, we propose a two-stage estimation procedure based on inverse probability weighting to achieve better precision without compromising objectivity. The procedure is designed in a way such that the covariate adjustment is performed before seeing the outcome, effectively reducing the possibility of selecting a “favorable” model that yields a strong intervention effect. Both theoretical and numerical properties of the estimation procedure are presented. Application of the proposed method to a real data example is presented.},

The expression and pathway enrichment of representative iron intake genes (TFRC and DMT1), utilization genes (FTH1, FTL, HIF1A, HMOX1, SLC25A37, and SLC25A38), and efflux genes (FLVCR1 and SLC40A1) was investigated in tumor and adjacent tissues. We determined the relationship between iron metabolism and the prognostic features of liver hepatocellular carcinoma. The liver metabolism genes TFRC and FLVCR1 were related to survival, disease status, and prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Drying is a highly dynamic process, thus, an effective optimisation in terms of product quality and process performance requires continuous non-invasive measurement of the parameters in question. In this study, visual to near infra-red hyperspectral imaging was used in combination with the respective gold standard methods to estimate moisture ratio, CIELab chromaticity, browning index, shrinkage, and rehydration ratio of apple slices during the hot air-drying process. Two varieties (cv. Elstar and Golden delicious) of apples at three slice thicknesses (2, 3, and 4 mm) were dried at 60 °C and 70 °C. Prediction models for the space-averaged spectral reflectance curves were built using the partial least square regression method and including both varieties. The performance of moisture ratio prediction was excellent (adj R2 = 0.94, RMSEP = 0.076) and the Variable Importance in the Projection value cut off above 0.8 at 970 nm and L* at 685 nm. Similarly, partial least square regression modelling showed a good prediction for a*, b* value, BI, shrinkage and acceptable prediction for L* and RR. The model performance was robust to the system settings irrespective of slice thickness, drying temperature and apple variety. Additionally, method comparisons using Bland-Altman, Bablok, and Deming regression were performed. The results confirm that the compared destructive (laboratory gold standard) and non-destructive hyperspectral methods can be interchangeably used within the limit of agreement (± 1.96 standard deviations) and precision for determination of the MR, CIELAB chromaticity and BI, shrinkage, and rehydration ratio. Therefore, these results confirm that hyperspectral imaging system can be used in online monitoring of the apples during the drying process, and thus, in the optimisation of product and process performance quality attributes.},

Rats fed excess iron in the diet had more mammary carcinomas than rats fed the recommended level of iron. A significantly greater proportion of carcinomas in rats fed the excess iron diet had the normal Ha-ras gene rather than the mutated form (G→A transition mutation in codon 12). In non-tumor bearing rats, mammary epithelial cells in lobules were the primary site of iron accumulation. However, in mammary carcinomas, a shift in the distribution of iron from the epithelial cells to the stroma was noted. Iron was predominantly found in tumor stroma; malignant epithelial cells failed to accumulate comparable levels of iron. These observations indicate that in the presence of excess iron there is an increase in the number of mammary carcinomas that do not bear the mutant Ha-ras gene. Whether changes in the distribution of iron within the mammary gland contribute to the altered pathogenetic characteristics of these tumors is being investigated.},

In this review, the use of human nails to measure exposure to arsenic and selenium is discussed in the context of the biomarker validation framework. Literature related to both analytical procedures and intrinsic characteristics of the biomarker is reviewed. Specifically, the followings are addressed: sample collection and preparation methods, establishment of the exposure–biomarker relationship, intraindividual variability and reproducibility of measurements, and biomarker–disease investigations. Drawing from a rapidly growing body of literature, current knowledge of these biomarker validation steps is assessed. Therefore, this review brings attention to the important issue of biomarker validation, laying the framework for future studies measuring elemental composition of nails.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Many biologic functions depend on sufficient iron levels, and iron deficiency is especially common among blood donors. Genetic variants associated with iron levels have been identified, but the impact of genetic variation on iron levels among blood donors remains unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The effect of six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on ferritin levels in 14,126 blood donors were investigated in four genes: in Human Hemochromatosis Protein gene (HFE; rs1800562 and rs179945); in Transmembrane Protease gene, Serine 6 (TMPRSS6-regulating hepcidin; rs855791); in BTB domain containing protein gene (BTBD9—associated with restless legs syndrome; rs9357271); and in the Transferrin gene (TF; rs2280673 and rs1830084). Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of each SNP on ferritin levels and the risk of iron deficiency (ferritin {$<$} 15 ng/mL). RESULTS In HFE, the G-allele of rs1800562 was associated with lower iron stores in both sexes. This was also true for the C-allele of rs179945, but in men only. Also, the T-allele of TMPRSS6 rs855791 was negatively associated with iron stores in men. Homozygocity for C in rs1799945 was associated with iron deficiency in women. Results for all other genetic variants were insignificant. CONCLUSION Genetic variants associated with hemochromatosis may protect donors against depleted iron stores. In addition, we showed that presence of the T-allele at rs855791 in TMPRSS6 was associated with lower iron stores in men.},

However, the prospective associations between functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL1B and incident acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have not been thoroughly investigated. The aims of this study were to examine the associations between individual SNPs in and SNP haplotypes of the promoter region of IL1B and incident ACS in a prospective study. Furthermore, we wanted to explore potential interactions with other risk factors for ACS on an additive scale. Methodology/Principal Findings: The present study was based on the Danish prospective study Diet, Cancer and Health comprising more than 57 000 participants aged 50–64 at baseline. During a median follow-up of 7.2 years we identified 989 cases of incident ACS (755 men and 234 women). All cases were validated by review of medical records, and information on covariates was collected by study technicians. The study was conducted according to a case-cohort study design including ACS cases and a sex-stratified sub cohort of 1663 participants drawn randomly from the entire cohort. Weighted Cox proportional hazard models with age as time axis were used in the statistical analyses. Individual IL1B SNPs, SNP haplotypes, or haplotype combinations were not significantly associated with incident ACS, and, likewise, we found no evidence of interaction on an additive scale between IL1B haplotypes and risk factors, respectively. Conclusions/Significance: Genetic variation in the promoter region of IL1B may not be associated with incident ACS in men or women above the age of 50 years.},

A common goal is to decide if a new measurement system agrees suitably with an existing one, and hence whether the two can be used interchangeably. Various methods for assessing interchangeability are available, the most popular being the limits of agreement approach due to Bland and Altman. In this article, we review the challenges of this technique and propose a model-based framework for comparing measurement systems that overcomes those challenges. The proposal is based on a simple metric, the probability of agreement, and a corresponding plot which can be used to summarize the agreement between two measurement systems. We also make recommendations for a study design that facilitates accurate and precise estimation of the probability of agreement.},

Although epidemiological evidence is mixed, there is overall support for this possibility. In addition, because of this same oxidative capacity, body iron levels may alter radiation sensitivity. In the present study, a nested case-control study of breast cancer was conducted in Japanese atomic bomb survivors.

Serum ferritin is the best feasible indicator of body iron levels in otherwise healthy people. A total of 107 cases and 212 controls were available for analysis. The relative risk (RR) of breast cancer for a 1 log unit increase in ferritin was 1.4 (95\% confidence interval 1.1–1.8).

The behaviour of the slope in illustrative hypothetical examples and in two examples in the clinical literature was demonstrated. Results The paper in which the statistic was proposed described it as a measure of “spread” and did not use the term “calibration”. In illustrative examples, slope of 1 can be associated with good or bad calibration, and this holds true across different definitions of calibration. In data extracted from a previous study, the slope was correlated with discrimination, not overall calibration. Many authors of recent papers interpret the slope as a measure of calibration; a minority interpret it as a measure of discrimination or do not explicitly categorise it as either. Seventeen of thirty-three papers used the slope as the sole measure of calibration. Conclusion Misunderstanding about this statistic has led to many papers in which it is the sole measure of calibration, which should be discouraged.},

  abstract = {Clinical prediction models provide risk estimates for the presence of disease (diagnosis) or an event in the future course of disease (prognosis) for individual patients. Although publications that present and evaluate such models are becoming more frequent, the methodology is often suboptimal. We propose that seven steps should be considered in developing prediction models: (i) consideration of the research question and initial data inspection; (ii) coding of predictors; (iii) model specification; (iv) model estimation; (v) evaluation of model performance; (vi) internal validation; and (vii) model presentation. The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. This illustrates the usefulness of the proposed framework to strengthen the methodological rigour and quality for prediction models in cardiovascular research.},

A key threat to validity is overfitting: the data under study are well described, but predictions are not valid for new subjects. Overfitting causes optimism about a model’s performance in new subjects. After introducing overfitting and optimism, we illustrate overfitting with a simple example of comparisons of mortality figures by hospital. We find that we would exaggerate any true patterns of differences between centers, if we would use the observed average outcomes per center as predictions of mortality. Bootstrap resampling is presented as a central technique to correct overfitting and quantify optimism in model performance.},

The standard requirement in major medical journals is nowadays that validity outside the development sample needs to be shown. Is such data splitting an example of a waste of resources? In large samples, interest should shift to assessment of heterogeneity in model performance across settings. In small samples, cross-validation and bootstrapping are more efficient approaches. In conclusion, random data splitting should be abolished for validation of prediction models.},

  abstract = {Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are major public health problems worldwide, especially in young women. Oral iron supplementation can be an effective strategy to treat and prevent IDA, but guidelines vary. Some experts recommend doses of 150–200 mg elemental iron per day, with the dose split through the day. However, recent studies suggest this may not be an optimal regimen. The fraction of iron absorbed from high doses of oral iron is low, and unabsorbed iron can cause gut irritation, inflammation and dysbiosis, and these reduce compliance. In recent studies using serum hepcidin profiles and stable iron isotopes to quantify iron absorption in young women, we have shown that: (a) oral iron doses ≥60 mg in iron-deficient women, and doses ≥100 mg in women with IDA, stimulate an acute increase in hepcidin that persists 24 h after the dose, but subsides by 48 h; (b) therefore, to maximize fractional iron absorption, oral doses ≥60 mg should be given on alternate days; (c) the circadian increase in plasma hepcidin is augmented by a morning iron dose; therefore, iron doses should not be given in the afternoon or evening after a morning dose. If rate of Hb response is important, a pooled analysis of our data done for this review indicates that total iron absorption is also higher if twice the target daily iron dose is given on alternate days. In summary, these studies suggest changing from daily to alternate-day schedules and from divided to morning single doses increases iron absorption and may reduce side effects. Thus, providing morning doses of 60–120 mg iron as a ferrous salt given with ascorbic acid on alternate days may be an optimal oral dosing regimen for women with iron-deficiency and mild IDA.},

  abstract = {Background: Breast cancer prognosis is strongly associated with tumor size at diagnosis. We aimed to identify factors associated with diagnosis of large ({$>$} 2 cm) compared to small tumors, and to examine implications for long-term prognosis. Methods: We examined 2012 women with invasive breast cancer, of whom 1466 had screen-detected and 546 interval cancers that were incident between 2001 and 2008 in a population-based screening cohort, and followed them to 31 December 2015. Body mass index (BMI) was ascertained after diagnosis at the time of study enrollment during 2009. PD was measured based on the contralateral mammogram within 3 years before diagnosis. We used multiple logistic regression modeling to examine the association between tumor size and body mass index (BMI), mammographic percent density (PD), or hormonal and genetic risk factors. Associations between the identified risk factors and, in turn, the outcomes of local recurrence, distant metastases, and death (153 events in total) in women with breast cancer were examined using Cox regression. Analyses were carried out according to mode of detection. Results: BMI and PD were the only factors associated with tumor size at diagnosis. For BMI (≥25 vs. {$<$} 25 kg/m2), the multiple adjusted odds ratios (OR) were 1.37 (95\% CI 1.02–1.83) and 2.12 (95\% CI 1.41–3.18), for screen-detected and interval cancers, respectively. For PD (≥20 vs. {$<$} 20\%), the corresponding ORs were 1.72 (95\% CI 1.29–2.30) and 0.60 (95\% CI 0.40–0.90). Among women with interval cancers, those with high BMI had worse prognosis than women with low BMI (hazard ratio 1.70; 95\% CI 1.04–2.77), but PD was not associated with the hazard rate. Among screen-detected cancers, neither BMI nor PD was associated with the hazard rate. Conclusions: In conclusion, high BMI was associated with the risk of having a tumor larger than 2 cm at diagnosis. Among women with interval cancer, high BMI was associated with worse prognosis. We believe that women with high BMI should be especially encouraged to attend screening.},

  abstract = {The determination of iron status is challenging when concomitant infection and inflammation are present because of confounding effects of the acute-phase response on the interpretation of most iron indicators. This review summarizes the effects of inflammation on indicators of iron status and assesses the impact of a regression analysis to adjust for inflammation on estimates of iron deficiency (ID) in low- and high-infection-burden settings. We overviewed cross-sectional data from 16 surveys for preschool children (PSC) (n = 29,765) and from 10 surveys for nonpregnant women of reproductive age (WRA) (n = 25,731) from the Biomarkers Reflecting the Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project. Effects of C-reactive protein (CRP) and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) concentrations on estimates of ID according to serum ferritin (SF) (used generically to include plasma ferritin), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and total body iron (TBI) were summarized in relation to infection burden (in the United States compared with other countries) and population group (PSC compared with WRA). Effects of the concentrations of CRP and AGP on SF, sTfR, and TBI were generally linear, especially in PSC. Overall, regression correction changed the estimated prevalence of ID in PSC by a median of +25 percentage points (pps) when SF concentrations were used, by -15 pps when sTfR concentrations were used, and by +14 pps when TBI was used; the estimated prevalence of ID in WRA changed by a median of +8 pps when SF concentrations were used, by -10 pps when sTfR concentrations were used, and by +3 pps when TBI was used. In the United States, inflammation correction was done only for CRP concentrations because AGP concentrations were not measured; regression correction for CRP concentrations increased the estimated prevalence of ID when SF concentrations were used by 3 pps in PSC and by 7 pps in WRA. The correction of iron-status indicators for inflammation with the use of regression correction appears to substantially change estimates of ID prevalence in low- and high-infection-burden countries. More research is needed to determine the validity of inflammation-corrected estimates, their dependence on the etiology of inflammation, and their applicability to individual iron-status assessment in clinical settings.},

In this study we evaluated the association between Fe concentration in serum, iron metabolism parameters and genetic variaton in 7 genes involved in iron metabolism and anti-oxidative processes with the incidence of lung cancer in Poland. Materials and methods The study included 200 lung cancer patients and 200 matched healthy control subjects. We analyzed serum iron concentration and iron metabolism parameters (TIBC, UIBC, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation), and genotyped seven variants in seven genes: HFE, TFR1, HAMP, TF, SOD2, CAT and GPX1. Results Lung cancer patients compared to their matched controls had significantly higher mean serum iron level (p = 0.01), ferritin level (p = 0.007) and TIBC (p = 0.006). Analysis revealed that higher concentration of iron and ferritin (IVth quartile) compared to the lower concentration (Ist quartile) was associated with over 2-fold increased lung cancer incidence. We also found that higher transferrin saturation (p = 0.01) and lower TIBC (p{$<$}0.01) are associated with better survival of lung cancer patients. The analysis of polymorphisms in iron related genes did not reveal a significant difference between lung cancer patients and controls. However, rs10421768 in HAMP showed a borderline statistically significant correlation with lung cancer risk (OR = 2.83, p = 0.05). Conclusions The results of this case control study indicate that higher body iron represented by higher Fe and ferritin levels may be associated with lung cancer incidence. Rs10421768 in HAMP may be associated with about 3-times higher lung cancer risk. Higher Fe body content may be associated with better survival of lung cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Background To reveal roles of reactive oxygen species (ROS) status in chemotherapy resistance and to develop a ROS scoring system for prognosis prediction in ovarian cancer. Methods We tested the sensitizing effects of ROS elevating drugs to cisplatin (cDDP) in ovarian cancer both in vitro and in vivo. A ROS scoring system was developed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database of ovarian cancer. The associations between ROS scores and overall survival (OS) were analyzed in TCGA, Tothill dataset, and our in-house dataset (TJ dataset). Results ROS-inducing drugs increased cisplatin-induced ovarian cancer cell injury in vitro and in vivo. ROS scoring system was established using 25 ROS-related genes. Patients were divided into low (scores 0-12) and high (scores 13-25) score groups. Improved patient survival was associated with higher scores (TCGA dataset hazard ratio (HR) = 0.43, P {$<$} 0.001; Tothill dataset HR = 0.65, P = 0.022; TJ dataset HR = 0.40, P = 0.003). The score was also significantly associated with OS in multiple datasets (TCGA dataset r(2) = 0.574, P = 0.032; Thothill dataset r(2) = 0.266, P = 0.049; TJ dataset r(2) = 0.632, P = 0.001) and with cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer cell lines (r(2) = 0.799, P = 0.016) when used as a continuous variable. The scoring system showed better prognostic performance than other clinical factors by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (TCGA dataset area under the curve (AUC) = 0.71 v.s. 0.65, Tothill dataset AUC = 0.73 v.s. 0.67, TJ dataset AUC = 0.74 v.s. 0.66).

The HRQOL factor and CRC screenings factor were developed in the NHIS cancer file. By using the Andersen model, confirmatory factor analysis with a multiple indicators, multiple causes model comprised data analysis. Results: CRC screening rates were negatively associated with HRQOL. Identifying oneself as an African American was associated with better HRQOL but lower cancer screening rates.

We postulated the existence of a statin–iron nexus by which statins improve cardiovascular disease outcomes at least partially by countering proinflammatory effects of excess iron stores., Methods. Using data from a clinical trial of iron (ferritin) reduction in advanced peripheral arterial disease, the Iron and Atherosclerosis Study, we compared effects of ferritin levels versus high-density lipoprotein to low-density lipoprotein ratios (both were randomization variables) on clinical outcomes in participants receiving and not receiving statins., Results. Statins increased high-density lipoprotein to low-density lipoprotein ratios and reduced ferritin levels by noninteracting mechanisms. Improved clinical outcomes were associated with lower ferritin levels but not with improved lipid status., Conclusions. There are commonalities between the clinical benefits of statins and the maintenance of physiologic iron levels. Iron reduction may be a safe and low-cost alternative to statins.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing worldwide prevalence of obesity and iron deficiency (ID), there are still no guidelines on how to treat and manage obesity-related ID. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate whether weight loss can re-establish iron homoeostasis among subjects with unhealthy weight (overweight [OW] or obesity). PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were systemically searched for studies that compared the iron status before and after a weight-loss intervention. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled and subgroup weighted mean differences (WMDs) of iron biomarkers. In total, 879 subjects were pooled across 14 studies. Improved haemoglobin was found in longitudinal studies (WMD = 2.50 g/dl, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88, 4.12 g/dl, I2 = 14\%) but not in randomized controlled trials or after being stratified by dietary programmes. Significantly increased transferrin saturation was observed in pooled (WMD = 1.68\%, 95\% CI: 0.97\%, 2.39\%, I2 = 44\%) and subgroup analyses. A meta-regression showed that changes in the iron status were positively correlated with changes in the body mass index (BMI) and the intervention duration but negatively correlated with the baseline body weight/BMI, age, gender and a standard hypocaloric diet. Our data suggested that in spite of energy restrictions, weight loss may help re-establish iron homoeostasis in people who are OW or obese.},

  abstract = {Hepcidin is a circulating peptide hormone made by the liver that is a central regulator of systemic iron uptake and recycling. Here we report that prostate epithelial cells also synthesize hepcidin, and that synthesis and secretion of hepcidin are markedly increased in prostate cancer cells and tissue. Prostatic hepcidin functions as an autocrine hormone, decreasing cell surface ferroportin, an iron exporter, increasing intracellular iron retention, and promoting prostate cancer cell survival. Synthesis of hepcidin in prostate cancer is controlled by a unique intersection of pathways that involves BMP4/7, IL6, Wnt, and the dual BMP and Wnt antagonist, SOSTDC1. Epigenetic silencing of SOSTDC1 through methylation is increased in prostate cancer, and is associated with accelerated disease progression in prostate cancer patients. These results establish a new connection between iron metabolism and prostate cancer, and suggest that prostatic dysregulation of hepcidin contributes to prostate cancer growth and progression.},

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is associated with chronic inflammation caused by liver fluke infection. To investigate the relationship between protein carbonylation and CCA progression, carbonylated proteins were detected by 2D OxyBlot and identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF analyses in pooled CCA tissues in comparison to adjacent nontumor tissues and normal liver tissues. We identified 14 highly carbonylated proteins in CCA tissues. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of individual samples confirmed significantly greater carbonylation of serotransferrin, heat shock protein 70-kDa protein 1 (HSP70.1), and α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. The oxidative modification of these proteins was significantly associated with poor prognoses as determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry identified R50, K327, and P357 as carbonylated sites in serotransferrin, HSP70.1, and A1AT, respectively. Moreover, iron accumulation was significantly higher in CCA tissues with, compared to those without, carbonylated serotransferrin. We conclude that carbonylated serotransferrin-associated iron accumulation may induce oxidative stress via the Fenton reaction, and the carbonylation of HSP70.1 with antioxidative property and A1AT with protease inhibitory capacity may cause them to become dysfunctional, leading to CCA progression.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of BMI with premenopausal breast cancer risk, in particular by age at BMI, attained age, risk factors for breast cancer, and tumor characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter analysis used pooled individual-level data from 758 592 premenopausal women from 19 prospective cohorts to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of premenopausal breast cancer in association with BMI from ages 18 through 54 years using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Median follow-up was 9.3 years (interquartile range, 4.9-13.5 years) per participant, with 13 082 incident cases of breast cancer. Participants were recruited from January 1, 1963, through December 31, 2013, and data were analyzed from September 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017. EXPOSURES Body mass index at ages 18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, and 45 to 54 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Invasive or in situ premenopausal breast cancer. RESULTS Among the 758 592 premenopausal women (median age, 40.6 years; interquartile range, 35.2-45.5 years) included in the analysis, inverse linear associations of BMI with breast cancer risk were found that were stronger for BMI at ages 18 to 24 years (HR per 5 kg/m2 [5.0-U] difference, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.73-0.80) than for BMI at ages 45 to 54 years (HR per 5.0-U difference, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.86-0.91). The inverse associations were observed even among nonoverweight women. There was a 4.2-fold risk gradient between the highest and lowest BMI categories (BMIՆ35.0 vs {$<$}17.0) at ages 18 to 24 years (HR, 0.24; 95\% CI, 0.14-0.40). Hazard ratios did not appreciably vary by attained age or between strata of other breast cancer risk factors. Associations were stronger for estrogen receptor–positive and/or progesterone receptor–positive than for hormone receptor–negative breast cancer for BMI at every age group (eg, for BMI at age 18 to 24 years: HR per 5.0-U difference for estrogen receptor–positive and progesterone receptor–positive tumors, 0.76 [95\% CI, 0.70-0.81] vs hormone receptor–negative tumors, 0.85 [95\% CI: 0.76-0.95]); BMI at ages 25 to 54 years was not consistently associated with triple-negative or hormone receptor–negative breast cancer overall. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this study suggest that increased adiposity is associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer at a greater magnitude than previously shown and across the entire distribution of BMI. The strongest associations of risk were observed for BMI in early adulthood. Understanding the biological mechanisms underlying these associations could have important preventive potential.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis that low body iron stores are protective against cancer whereas high body stores promote tumor occurrence was examined in the 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced experimental model for breast cancer. Twenty-one-day-old female Sprague–Dawley rats were randomized into one of three experimental groups and fed a formulation of AIN-76A diet modified to be low in iron (2 p.p.m.), or the same diet supplemented with an adequate (120 p.p.m.) or excess (1200 p.p.m.) amount of iron provided as FeSO4.7H2O. Rats were maintained on their respective diets throughout the experiment which was terminated 32 weeks post carcinogen administration. Rats were injected i.p. with either 25 mg MNU/kg body wt or the saline-solvent in which MNU was dissolved at 50 days of age. In the first 14 weeks, dietary iron deficiency resulted in a low hematocrit and a decrease in weight gain. The appearance of mammary tumors was markedly suppressed in this group compared to those given an adequate or excess level of iron. It has been reported in the literature that reduction in weight gain due to food restriction at a period immediately after carcinogen administration severely inhibits the subsequent development of tumors. Thus the low tumor incidence in the iron-deficient rats during this time frame could be attributed to the combined effects of low hematocrit and depressed weight gain. For the period between week 14 and week 32, the hematocrit in the iron-deficient animals was maintained at a normal level, and the body wt of these rats was comparable to that of the controls given an adequate level of iron. The rate of tumor appearance in the iron-deficient group during the second half of the experiment was similar to that of the iron-adequate group in the first half of the experiment. In other words, it appeared that once hematocrit and body wt gain were restored to normal in the iron-deficient animals, tumor incidence was only minimally affected by low dietary iron. In the second half of the experiment, the tumor incidence in the adequate iron group seemed to have plateaued, whereas it continued to rise in the excess iron group. Thus excess iron appears to be more prominent than iron deficiency in modification of mammary carcinogenesis, especially when the confounding effects of low hematocrit and reduced weight gain are taken into consideration in the latter case.},

Current issues include improving prognostic evaluation and increasing therapeutic options for women whose tumors are refractory to current frontline therapies. Iron metabolism is frequently disrupted in breast cancer, and may offer an opportunity to address these challenges. Iron enhances breast tumor initiation, growth and metastases. Iron may contribute to breast tumor initiation by promoting redox cycling of estrogen metabolites. Up-regulation of iron import and down-regulation of iron export may enable breast cancer cells to acquire and retain excess iron. Alterations in iron metabolism in macrophages and other cells of the tumor microenvironment may also foster breast tumor growth. Expression of iron metabolic genes in breast tumors is predictive of breast cancer prognosis. Iron chelators and other strategies designed to limit iron may have therapeutic value in breast cancer. The dependence of breast cancer on iron presents rich opportunities for improved prognostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention.},

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between excess iron and increased cancer incidence and risk, while experimental studies have implicated iron in cancer initiation, tumor growth, and metastasis. The roles of iron in proliferation, metabolism, and metastasis underpin the association of iron with tumor growth and progression. Cancer cells exhibit an iron-seeking phenotype achieved through dysregulation of iron metabolic proteins. These changes are mediated, at least in part, by oncogenes and tumor suppressors. The dependence of cancer cells on iron has implications in a number of cell death pathways, including ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. Uniquely, both iron excess and iron depletion can be utilized in anticancer therapies. Investigating the efficacy of these therapeutic approaches is an area of active research that promises substantial clinical impact.},

Traditional approaches to mediation in the biomedical and social sciences are described. Attention is given to the confounding assumptions required for a causal interpretation of direct and indirect effect estimates. Methods from the causal inference literature to conduct mediation in the presence of exposure-mediator interactions, binary outcomes, binary mediators, and case-control study designs are presented. Sensitivity analysis techniques for unmeasured confounding and measurement error are introduced. Discussion is given to extensions to time-to-event outcomes and multiple mediators. Further flexible modeling strategies arising from the precise counterfactual definitions of direct and indirect effects are also described. The focus throughout is on methodology that is easily implementable in practice across a broad range of potential applications.},

Since their approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in the 1980s, other potential uses for statins have been speculated on and explored. Basic science and clinical research suggest that statins are also effective in the management of breast cancer. Specifically, in various breast cancer cell lines, statins increase apoptosis and radiosensitivity, inhibit proliferation and invasion, and decrease the metastatic dissemination of tumors. Clinical trials in breast cancer patients support these laboratory findings by demonstrating improved local control and a mortality benefit for statin users. A role for statins in the management of aggressive breast cancers with poor outcomes – namely, inflammatory breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer – is particularly implicated. However, data exist showing that statins may actually promote invasive breast disease after long-term use and thus should be prescribed cautiously. Furthermore, a general consensus on the type of statin that should be administered, for how long, and when in relation to time of diagnosis is lacking. Given their low toxicity profile, affordability, and ease of use, consideration of statins as a therapy for breast cancer patients is imminent. In this review, we summarize current evidence regarding statins and clinical breast cancer outcomes, as well as discuss potential future studies that could shed light on this increasingly relevant topic.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 469 men and 278 premenopausal and 197 postmenopausal women from the French Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) cohort, aged 30-65 years, were followed over 6 years. RESULTS - Higher concentrations of both ferritin and transferrin were associated with the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults Adult Treatment Panel III original and revised definitions of the metabolic syndrome at baseline: for the IDF definition of the metabolic syndrome, the standardized, age-adjusted odds ratios (95\% CI) for log(ferritin) were 1.49 (1.14-1.94) for men, 2.10 (1.27-3.48) for premenopausal women, and 1.80 (1.21-2.68) for postmenopausal women; for transferrin they were, respectively, 1.94 (1.53-2.47) 2.22 (1.32-3.75), and 2.14 (1.47-3.10). After 6 years of follow-up, the change in the presence of the metabolic syndrome was associated with higher baseline values in all three groups: log(ferritin), 1.46 (1.13-1.89), 1.28 (0.85-1.94), and 1.62 (1.10-2.38); and transferrin, 1 41 (1.10-1.81): 1.63 (1.05-2.52), and 1.51 (1.02-2.22). Among syndrome components, hypertriglyceridemia at 6 years was the component most strongly associated with baseline ferritin and transferrin. The odds of an incident IDF-defined metabolic syndrome after 6 years was more than fourfold higher when ferritin and transferrin values were both above the group-specific top tertile, in comparison with participants with both parameters below these thresholds. CONCLUSIONS - This is the first prospective study associating ferritin and transferrin with the metabolic syndrome and its components. When both markers of the iron metabolism are elevated, the incidence of the metabolic syndrome is increased in men and both pre- and postmenopausal women.},

The authors proposed the alternative use of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to define such patterns. Objective: The aim was to compare dietary patterns derived through PCA and CFA used as equivalent approaches in terms of stability and relevance. Design: PCA and CFA were performed in 2 different studies: the Epidemiological Study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma 2–France (EGEA2-France; n = 1236) and the Phenotype and Course of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease study–Spain (n = 274). To check for stability, PCA and CFA were also performed in 2 subsamples from the EGEA2 study (n = 618 and 309). Statistical proprieties were evaluated by 1000 bootstrapped random sets of observations for each of the 4 subsamples. For each random set of observations, the distribution of the factor loading for each pattern was obtained and represented by using box-plots. To check for relevance, partial correlations between different nutrients and the different patterns derived by either PCA or CFA were calculated. Results: With the use of CFA, 2 consistent dietary patterns were derived in each subsample (the Prudent and the Western patterns), whereas dietary factors were less interpretable with the use of PCA (smaller median of factor loadings and higher dispersion), especially for the smallest subsample. Higher correlations were reported among total fiber, vitamins, minerals, and total lipids with patterns derived by using CFA than with patterns derived by using PCA. Conclusion: The current study shows that CFA may be a useful alternative to PCA in epidemiologic studies, especially when the sample size is small. Am J Clin Nutr 2012;96:1079–92.},

Reliance on standardised tools places demands on clinicians to understand their properties, strengths, and weaknesses, in order to interpret results and make clinical decisions. This paper makes a case for clinicians to consider measurement error (ME) indices Coefficient of Repeatability (CR) or the Smallest Real Difference (SRD) over relative reliability coefficients like the Pearson’s (r) and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), while selecting tools to measure change and inferring change as true. The authors present statistical methods that are part of the current approach to evaluate test–retest reliability of assessment tools and outcome measurements. Selected examples from a previous test–retest study are used to elucidate the added advantages of knowledge of the ME of an assessment tool in clinical decision making. The CR is computed in the same units as the assessment tool and sets the boundary of the minimal detectable true change that can be measured by the tool.},

Studies suggest that there are two sources of hepcidin in the brain; one is local and the other comes from the circulation. Little is known about the molecular mediators of local hepcidin expression, but inflammation and iron-load have been shown to induce hepcidin expression in the brain. The most important source of hepcidin in the brain are glial cells. Role of hepcidin in brain functions has been observed during neuronal iron-load and brain hemorrhage, where secretion of abundant hepcidin is related with the severity of brain damage. This damage can be reversed by blocking systemic and local hepcidin secretion. Studies have yet to unveil its role in other brain conditions, but the rationale exists, since these conditions are characterized by overexpression of the factors that stimulate brain hepcidin expression, such as inflammation, hypoxia and iron-overload.},

However, considering the complexity of diets among Indians, the relationship between a particular dietary pattern and the nutritional status of the population has not been established so far. A community-based cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess estimates, at district level, of diet and nutritional status in Orissa State, India. Factor analysis was used for exploring the existence of consumption pattern of food and nutrients and their relationship with the nutritional status of rural adult population. Data on 2,864 adult men and 3,525 adult women in Orissa state revealed that there exists six patterns among food-groups explaining 59\% of the total variation and three patterns among nutrients that explain 73\% of the total variation among both adult men and women. The discriminant function analysis revealed that, overall, 53\% of the men were correctly classified as either with chronic energy deficiency (CED) or without CED. Similarly, overall, 54\% of the women were correctly classified as either with CED or without CED. The sensitivity of the model was 65\% for both men and women, and the specificity was 46\% and 41\% respectively for men and women. In the case of classification of overweight/obesity, the prediction of the model was about 75\% among both men and women, along with high sensitivity. Using factor analysis, the dietary patterns were identified from the food and nutrient intake data. There exists a strong relationship between the dietary patterns and the nutritional status of rural adults. These results will help identify the community people with CED and help planners formulate nutritional interventions accordingly.},

  abstract = {Background: Iron is both essential to life and potentially toxic at higher levels. Epidemiologic studies of iron and breast cancer are sparse, with substantial heterogeneity found in a recent meta-analysis. Evidence based on a comprehensive set of iron biomarkers and a large sample size could help clarify relationships between iron body stores and breast cancer risk. Methods: A case–cohort sample of 6,008 women, including 3,011 incident cases, has been followed for a median of 7.9 years. We estimated breast cancer HRs with Cox models, including age as the primary time scale and including in turn iron, ferritin, percent transferrin saturation, and their first principal component (PC) both as categorical (quartiles) and continuous measures. Results: Adjusted HRs for the highest versus lowest quartiles of iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (95\% confidence interval) were 1.06 (0.90–1.25), 1.03 (0.87–1.23), and 0.94 (0.80–1.12), respectively, and 1.06 (0.90–1.25) for the first principal component (PC). Associations were similar when follow-up time was restricted to ≤4 or {$>$}2 years. Post hoc analyses suggested low iron stores were associated with reduced breast cancer risk, in both pre- and postmenopause and the obese. Conclusions: A study with one of the largest sample sizes to date and with all three measures of circulating iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation does not support a strong association between elevated iron stores and breast cancer risk. Further investigation of low iron may be warranted. Impact: These results do not support a strong association between iron overload and breast cancer incidence.},

Although the regulation of MFG size in the mammary epithelial cell is not fully understood, lipid droplet (LD) fusion prior to secretion is believed to play a role. We selected cows that consistently produced milk with predominantly small or large MFGs to compare their lipidomic profiles, with focus on the polar lipid fraction. The polar lipid composition of the monolayer surrounding the LD is believed to either promote or prevent LD fusion. Using a targeted LC–MS/MS approach we studied the relative abundance of 301 detected species and found significant differences between the studied groups. Here we show that the lipidomic profile of milk from small MFG cows is characterised by higher phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine ratios. In contrast, the milk from large MFG cows contained more ether-phosphatidylethanolamine species. This is the first time that a potential role for ether-phosphatidylethanolamine in MFG size development has been suggested.},

  abstract = {Research on the interplay between iron and copper metabolism in humans began to flourish in the mid-20th century, and diseases associated with dysregulated homeostasis of these essential trace minerals are common even today. Iron deficiency is the most frequent cause of anemia worldwide, leading to significant morbidity, particularly in developing countries. Iron overload is also quite common, usually being the result of genetic mutations which lead to inappropriate expression of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin. Perturbations of copper homeostasis in humans have also been described, including rare genetic conditions which lead to severe copper deficiency (Menkes disease) or copper overload (Wilson disease). Historically, the common laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) was the most frequently utilized species to model human physiology and pathophysiology. Recently, however, the development of genetic-engineering technology combined with the worldwide availability of numerous genetically homogenous (i.e., inbred) mouse strains shifted most research on iron and copper metabolism to laboratory mice. This created new opportunities to understand the function of individual genes in the context of a living animal, but thoughtful consideration of whether mice are the most appropriate models of human pathophysiology was not necessarily involved. Given this background, this review is intended to provide a guide for future research on iron-and copper-related disorders in humans. Generation of complementary experimental models in rats, swine, and other mammals is now facile given the advent of newer genetic technologies, thus providing the opportunity to accelerate the identification of pathogenic mechanisms and expedite the development of new treatments to mitigate these important human disorders.},

  abstract = {In biomarker-disease association studies, the long-term average level of a biomarker is often considered the optimal measure of exposure. Long-term average levels may not be accurately measured from a single sample, however, because of systematic temporal variation. For example, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations may fluctuate because of seasonal variation in sun exposure. Association studies of 25(OH)D and cancer risk have used different strategies to minimize bias from such seasonal variation, including adjusting for date of sample collection (DOSC), often after matching on DOSC, and/or using season-specific cutpoints to assign subjects to exposure categories. To evaluate and understand the impact of such strategies on potential bias, the authors simulated a population in which 25(OH)D levels varied between individuals and by season, and disease risk was determined by long-term average 25(OH)D. Ignoring temporal variation resulted in bias toward the null. When cutpoints that did not account for DOSC were used, adjustment for DOSC sometimes resulted in bias away from the null. Using season- or month-specific cutpoints reduced bias toward the null and did not cause bias away from the null. To avoid potential bias away from the null, using season- or month-specific cutpoints may be preferable to adjusting for DOSC.},

In vivo studies in mice have also demonstrated that an iron deficiency induced by either feeding a low iron diet or injecting the ir on chelator deferoxamine mesylate decreases tumor growth. In this study Fisher rats were transplanted with the 13762NF mammary adenocarcinoma and divided into four groups: normal diet, normal diet plus deferoxamine mesylate treatment low iron diet and low iron diet plus deferoxamine mesylate treatment. The measurements of tumor size and body weight were recorded weekly. We found that treatment with either deferoxamine mesylate or a low iron diet decreased rat tumor. growth, but the greatest inhibitory effect on tumor growth occurred when the rats were treated with deferoxamine mesylate injections plus fed a low iron diet. These treatments did not significantly inhibit the weight gain of the rats. At the end of the experiments measurement of serum iron proved that these treatment caused iron deficiency, but there was no significant treatment related alteration in blood hematocrit. We therefore concluded that deferoxamine mesylate may be a useful chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancel; wizen used in combination with standard chemotherapeutic regimens ol with other agents that interfere with iron metabolism, and further that the restricting of iron intake should be considered when planning chemotherapy for all cancer patients.},

Methods: Included were 6,574 men ages 45–64 years who enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study in 1987 to 1989. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the association of serum urate concentration alone and to improve accuracy, jointly with a genetic risk score (GRS, N = 4,983) derived from variants predictive of urate concentration, with prostate cancer (N = 813) risk. Results: Serum urate concentration or joint categories of urate concentration and GRS were not associated with prostate cancer risk (Ptrend for quartiles = 0.3). Results were generally similar by race and after excluding users of medications that influence uric acid. Conclusions: Serum urate alone and with a urate-associated GRS were not associated with prostate cancer risk. Impact: It is unlikely that circulating urate concentration influences prostate cancer development.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Previous reports have identified the important role of zinc in bone health. Although the risk of zinc deficiency is still a concern in the U.S., there has never been an in-depth study of the association between zinc status and bone health in a sample representing the country. Methods: We included 2,895 subjects (aged ≥ 40 years) from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2014 to explore the relationship among three biomarkers of zinc (serum, food, and total intake), the bone mineral density (BMD) of the total spine and femur, the FRAX® scores, and the previous history of bone fractures. Results: We showed a one-unit increase in the ln-serum zinc level was associated with an increase in the total spine BMD (ß = 0.068; S.E. = 0.028; P = 0.030) and total femur BMD (ß = 0.061; S.E. = 0.017; P = 0.003), while a one-unit increase in the ln-food zinc intake amount was correlated with an increase in the total femur BMD in the participants (ß = 0.023; S.E. = 0.009; P = 0.021). The ln-total zinc intake amount was correlated with an increase in the total femur BMD in women (ß = 0.016; S.E. = 0.007; P = 0.041). We also found food zinc intake was negatively correlated with the FRAX® score, while increased levels of all three zinc biomarkers were associated with a decreased incidence of previous bone fractures. Conclusions: In this representative survey of American adults above 40 years old, higher zinc status was asso­ ciated with higher total spine and femoral BMD, lower FRAX® scores, and lower incidence of previous fractures. If this finding is causal, increased zinc intake remains an important issue for Americans.},

  abstract = {Background and Aim—Women who are homozygous for the p.C282Y mutation in the HFE gene are at much lower risk of iron overload-related disease than p.C282Y homozygous men, presumably due to the iron-depleting effects of menstruation and pregnancy. We used data from a population cohort study to model the impact of menstruation cessation at menopause on serum ferritin (SF) levels in female p.C282Y homozygotes, with p.C282Y/p.H63D simple or compound heterozygotes and those with neither p.C282Y nor p.H63D mutations (HFE wild-types) as comparison groups. Methods—A sample of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) was selected for the “HealthIron” study (n=1,438) including all HFE p.C282Y homozygotes plus a random sample stratified by HFE-genotype (p.C282Y and p.H63D). The relationship between the natural logarithm of SF and time since menopause was examined using linear mixed models incorporating spline smoothing. Results—For p.C282Y homozygotes, SF increased by a factor of 3.6 (95\% CI (1.8, 7.0), p {$<$} 0.001) during the first ten years post menopause, after which SF continued to increase but at less than half the previous rate. In contrast, SF profiles for other HFE genotype groups increase more gradually and did not show a distinction between pre- and post-menopausal SF levels. Only p.C282Y homozygotes had predicted SF exceeding 200 µg/L post-menopause, but the projected SF did not increase the risk of iron-overload related disease. Conclusions—These data provide the first documented evidence that physiological blood loss is a major factor in determining the marked gender difference in expression of p.C282Y homozygosity.},

  abstract = {Epidemiologic studies linking high serum iron with cancer risks are limited and inconclusive, despite evidence implicating body iron in human carcinogenesis. A cohort of 309,443 adults in Taiwan who had no history of cancer had serum iron levels tested at the time of recruitment (1997–2008). Initially measured iron levels were associated with subsequent cancer risk by linking individuals with the National Cancer Registry and National Death File. HRs were calculated by the Cox model. One third of males (35\%) and one fifth of females (18\%) had high serum iron (≥120 μg/dL), which was associated with a 25\% increase in risk for incidence of all cancers [HR, 1.25; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.16–1.35] and with a 39\% increase in risk for mortality from all cancers (HR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.23–1.57). The relationship between serum iron and cancer risk was a J-shaped one, with higher cancer risk at both ends, either at lower than 60 μg/dL or higher than 120 μg/dL. At the higher end, cancer risk increased by 4\% for every 10 μg/dL increment above 80 μg/dL, showing a dose–response relationship, with 60 to 79 μg/dL as a reference level. In a sensitivity analysis, the increases in risk were still observed after the first 5 years of cancer cases were excluded. Liver cancer risk was increased in HBV (−) non-hepatitis B carrier (3-fold) and HBV (+) hepatitis B carrier (24-fold). Lifestyle risks such as smoking, drinking, or inactivity interacted synergistically with high serum iron and significantly increased the cancer risks.

  abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the association between self-rated health and risk of type 2 diabetes and whether the strength of this association is consistent across five European centres. Design: Population-based prospective case-cohort study. Setting: Enrolment took place between 1992 and 2000 in five European centres (Bilthoven, Cambridge, Heidelberg, Potsdam and Umeå). Participants: Self-rated health was assessed by a baseline questionnaire in 3399 incident type 2 diabetic case participants and a centre-stratified subcohort of 4619 individuals from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct study which was drawn from a total cohort of 340 234 participants in the EPIC. Primary outcome measure: Prentice-weighted Cox regression was used to estimate centre-specific HRs and 95\% CIs for incident type 2 diabetes controlling for age, sex, centre, education, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, energy intake, physical activity and hypertension. The centre-specific HRs were pooled across centres by random effects meta-analysis. Results: Low self-rated health was associated with a higher hazard of type 2 diabetes after adjusting for age and sex ( pooled HR 1.67, 95\% CI 1.48 to 1.88). After additional adjustment for health-related variables including BMI, the association was attenuated but remained statistically significant ( pooled HR 1.29, 95\% CI 1.09 to 1.53). I2 index for heterogeneity across centres was 13.3\% ( p=0.33). Conclusions: Low self-rated health was associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. The association could be only partly explained by other health-related variables, of which obesity was the strongest. We found no indication of heterogeneity in the association between self-rated health and type 2 diabetes mellitus across the European centres.},

The adaptation to iron deficiency, which confers resistance to infection and improves the inflammatory condition, underlies what is probably the most obvious link: the anemia of inflammation or chronic disease. A large number of stimulatory inputs must be integrated to tightly control iron homeostasis during the inflammatory response. In order to understand the pathways of iron trafficking and how they are regulated, this chapter will present a brief overview of iron homeostasis. A major focus will be on the regulation of the peptide hormone hepcidin during the inflammatory response and how its function contributes to the process of iron withdrawal. The review will also summarize new and emerging information about other iron metabolic regulators and effectors that contribute to the inflammatory response. Potential benefits of treatment to ameliorate the hypoferremic condition promoted by inflammation will also be considered.},

  abstract = {Summary. Women have lower iron stores than men because of iron loss during their reproductive years. However, variation between women could result from differences in iron loss, aspects of iron homeostasis common to men and women, or a combination of both. We compared the effects of age, menopause, menstrual blood loss and the number of pregnancies (sex-specific factors), and the effects of genetic variation, on markers of iron stores. We assessed how much the same genes or other familial factors influence iron status in both men and women. Data from 2039 female twins who participated in studies of reproductive health and iron status were used to estimate the proportions of variation that could be ascribed to genes, environment and measured factors. Significant effects of age, menopausal status and magnitude of menstrual blood loss were demonstrated, accounting for up to 18\% of variance in serum ferritin in this sample, but number of children had no significant effect. Genetic effects were more than twice as great as sex-specific effects. The within-pair similarity of ferritin values in dizygotic female twin pairs was greater than for dizygotic opposite-sex pairs, but this difference was not quite significant, consistent with a minor role for sex-specific factors; and the opposite-sex within-pair differences did not diminish significantly with age. We conclude that the contribution of genetic differences between women to variation in iron stores outweighs the comparatively small effects of interindividual variation in iron loss through variation in menstruation and number of pregnancies.},

Focus is given to the multivariate normal distribution, and 9 separate decompositions (i.e., class structures) of the covariance matrix are investigated. To provide a link to the current literature, comparisons are made with K-means clustering in 3 detailed Monte Carlo studies. The findings have implications for applied researchers in that mixture-model clustering techniques performed best when the covariance structure and number of clusters were known. However, as the information about the shape and number of clusters became unknown, degraded performance was observed for both K-means clustering and mixture-model clustering.},

This article revisits the basis for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommendations regarding the use of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in guiding iron therapy, then explores some of the newer alternative markers for iron status that may be useful when serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are insufficient. These newer tests include reticulocyte hemoglobin content, percentage of hypochromic red cells, and soluble transferrin receptor, all of which have shown some promise in limited studies. Finally, the role of hepcidin, a hepatic polypeptide, in the pathophysiology of iron mobilization is reviewed briefly.},

  abstract = {k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells. The problem is computationally difficult (NP-hard); however, efficient heuristic algorithms converge quickly to a local optimum. These are usually similar to the expectation-maximization algorithm for mixtures of Gaussian distributions via an iterative refinement approach employed by both k-means and Gaussian mixture modeling. They both use cluster centers to model the data; however, k-means clustering tends to find clusters of comparable spatial extent, while the expectation-maximization mechanism allows clusters to have different shapes. The algorithm has a loose relationship to the k-nearest neighbor classifier, a popular machine learning technique for classification that is often confused with k-means due to the name. Applying the 1-nearest neighbor classifier to the cluster centers obtained by k-means classifies new data into the existing clusters. This is known as nearest centroid classifier or Rocchio algorithm.},

Iron plays a key role in both oxidative stress and photo-induced skin damage. The main causes of oxidative stress in the skin include reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in the skin by ultraviolet (UVA) 320–400 nm portion of the UVA spectrum and biologically available iron. We also discuss the relationships between iron deficiency, anemia and cutaneous wound healing. Studies looking at this fall into two distinct groups. Early studies investigated the effect of anemia on wound healing using a variety of experimental methodology to establish anemia or iron deficiency and focused on wound-strength rather than effect on macroscopic healing or re-epithelialization. More recent animal studies have investigated novel treatments aimed at correcting the effects of systemic iron deficiency and localized iron overload. Iron overload is associated with local cutaneous iron deposition, which has numerous deleterious effects in chronic venous disease and hereditary hemochromatosis. Iron plays a key role in chronic ulceration and conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Lupus Erythematosus are associated with both anemia of chronic disease and dysregulation of local cutaneous iron hemostasis. Iron is a potential therapeutic target in the skin by application of topical iron chelators and novel pharmacological agents, and in delayed cutaneous wound healing by treatment of iron deficiency or underlying systemic inflammation.},

Iron, transferrin saturation (TS), copper, and zinc were categorized into 4 levels using the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles for cutoffs. Relative risks (RRs) were derived from the proportional hazard models after adjustment for a number of potential confounders. RESULTS: Three hundred seven cancer deaths (ICD-9 140–195, 199–208) were identified during 83,664.4 person-years of follow-up. Cancer mortality per 1000 person-years was 3.7 (4.7 for men and 2.8 for women). For men and women combined, the adjusted RRs (95\% confidence intervals, CI) for the four levels were 0.96 (0.57–1.61), 1.00 (reference), 1.12 (0.80–1.58), 1.86 (1.07–3.22) for iron; 0.97 (0.56–1.70), 1.00 (reference), 1.36 (0.99–1.87), 1.82 (1.10–3.02) for TS; 0.76 (0.44–1.31), 1.00 (reference), 1.10 (0.77–1.58), 1.89 (1.07–3.32) for copper; and 0.75 (0.50–1.13), 1.00 (reference), 0.64 (0.47–0.88), 0.84 (0.53–1.33) for zinc. When the exposures were analyzed as continuous variables, the adjusted RRs (CI) were 1.66 (1.03–2.68) for 100 µg/dl iron increase, 1.17 (1.01–1.36) for 10\% TS increase, 1.98 (1.12–3.50) for 100 µg/dl copper increase, and 0.57 (0.16–1.96) for 100 µg/dl zinc increase. Sex differences in the adjusted RRs for iron, TS, and copper were suggestive. CONCLUSION: People with higher serum iron, TS, or copper concentrations had an increased risk of dying from cancer.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of aspirin on expression of iron uptake protein transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), iron release protein ferroportin 1 (Fpn1) and iron storage protein ferritin using Western blot analysis and on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-αlpha, interleukin (IL)-6, interleukin (IL)-10 and hepcidin using quantitative real-time PCR in BV-2 microglial cells treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We found that aspirin significantly down-regulated TfR1, while also up-regulated Fpn1 and ferritin expressions in BV-2 microglial cells in~vitro. We also showed that TfR1 and Fpn1 expressions were significantly higher, while ferritin contents, IL-6, TNF-alpha and hepcidin mRNA levels were lower in cells treated with aspirin plus LPS than those in cells treated with LPS only. We concluded that aspirin has a negative effect on cell iron contents under ‘normal’ conditions and could partly reverse LPS-induced-disruption in cell iron balance under in vitro inflammatory conditions. Our findings also suggested that hepcidin might play a dominant role in the control of TfR1 expression by aspirin in the cells treated with LPS.},

  abstract = {Dietary iron intake and systemic iron balance are implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) development, but the means by which iron contributes to CRC are unclear. Gene expression and functional studies demonstrated that the cellular iron importer, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), is highly expressed in CRC through hypoxia-inducible factor 2α-dependent transcription. Colon-specific Dmt1 disruption resulted in a tumor-selective inhibitory effect of proliferation in mouse colon tumor models. Proteomic and genomic analyses identified an iron-regulated signaling axis mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), JAK1, and STAT3 in CRC progression. A pharmacological inhibitor of DMT1 antagonized the ability of iron to promote tumor growth in a CRC mouse model and a patient-derived CRC enteroid orthotopic model. Our studies implicate a growth-promoting signaling network instigated by elevated intracellular iron levels in tumorigenesis, offering molecular insights into how a key dietary component may contribute to CRC.},

  abstract = {Background Human nail clippings are increasingly used in epidemiological studies as biomarkers for assessing diet and environmental exposure to trace elements or other chemical compounds. However, little is known about the growth rate of human nails. Objective To estimate the average growth rate of fingernails and toenails and examine factors that may influence nail growth rate. Methods Twenty-two healthy American young adults marked their nails close to the proximal nail fold with a provided nail file following a standardized protocol, and recorded the date and the distance from the proximal nail fold to the mark. One to three months later, participants recorded the date and distance from the proximal nail fold to the mark again. Nail growth rate was calculated based on recorded distance and time between the two measurements. Results Average fingernail growth rate was faster than that of toenails (3.47 vs. 1.62 mm/month, P {$<$} 0.01). There was no significant difference between right and left fingernail/toenail growth rates. The little fingernail grew slower than other fingernails (P {$<$} 0.01); the great toenail grew faster than other toenails (P {$<$} 0.01). Younger age, male gender, and onychophagia were associated with faster nail growth rate; however, the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion Nail growth rates have increased compared with previous estimates conducted decades ago. Toenail clippings may reflect a long exposure time frame given the relatively slow growth rate.},

  abstract = {Background The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) is the most commonly used scale for assessing quality of life in patients with breast cancer. The lack of preference-based measures limits the cost-utility of breast cancer in China. The goal of this study was to explore whether a mapping function can be established from the FACT-B to the EQ-5D-5\,L when the EQ-5D health-utility index is not available. Methods A cross-sectional survey of adults with breast cancer was conducted in China. All patients included in the study completed the EQ-5D-5\,L and the disease-specific FACT-B questionnaire, and demographic and clinical data were also collected. The Chinese tariff value was used to calculate the EQ-5D-5\,L utility scores. Five models were evaluated using three different modelling approaches: the ordinary least squares (OLS) model, the Tobit model and the two-part model (TPM). Total scores, domain scores, squared terms and interaction terms were introduced into models. The goodness of fit, signs of the estimated coefficients, and normality of prediction errors of the model were also assessed. The normality of the prediction error is determined by calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute deviation (MAD), and the mean absolute error (MAE). Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayes information criteria (BIC) were also used to assess models and predictive performances. The OLS model was followed by simple linear equating to avoid regression to the mean. Results The performance of the models was improved after the introduction of the squared terms and the interaction terms. The OLS model, including the squared terms and the interaction terms, performed best for mapping the EQ-5D-5\,L. The explanatory power of the OLS model was 70.0\%. The AIC and BIC of this model were the smallest (AIC\,=\,-705.106, BIC\,=\,-643.601). The RMSE, MAD and MAE of the OLS model, Tobit model and TPM were similar. The MAE values of the 5-fold cross-validation of the multiple models in this study were 0.07155\textasciitilde 0.08509; meanwhile, the MAE of the TPM was the smallest, followed by that of the OLS model. The OLS regression proved to be the most accurate for the mean, and linearly equated scores were much closer to observed scores. Conclusions This study establishes a mapping algorithm based on the Chinese population to estimate the EQ-5D-5\,L index of the FACT-B and confirms that OLS models have higher explanatory power and that TPMs have lower prediction error. Given the accuracy of the mean prediction and the simplicity of the model, we recommend using the OLS model. The algorithm can be used to calculate EQ-5D scores when EQ-5D data are not directly collected in a study.},

  abstract = {Observational epidemiological studies are prone to confounding, measurement error, and reverse causation, undermining robust causal inference. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants to proxy modifiable exposures to generate more reliable estimates of the causal effects of these exposures on diseases and their outcomes. MR has seen widespread adoption within cardio-metabolic epidemiology, but also holds much promise for identifying possible interventions for cancer prevention and treatment. However, some methodological challenges in the implementation of MR are particularly pertinent when applying this method to cancer aetiology and prognosis, including reverse causation arising from disease latency and selection bias in studies of cancer progression. These issues must be carefully considered to ensure appropriate design, analysis, and interpretation of such studies., In this review, we provide an overview of the key principles and assumptions of MR focusing on applications of this method to the study of cancer aetiology and prognosis. We summarize recent studies in the cancer literature that have adopted a MR framework to highlight strengths of this approach compared to conventional epidemiological studies. Lastly, limitations of MR and recent methodological developments to address them are discussed, along with the translational opportunities they present to inform public health and clinical interventions in cancer.},

Such scaling of the data, however, may affect the selection of biomarkers and the biological interpretation of results in unforeseen ways. Here, we studied how both the outcome of hypothesis tests for differential metabolite concentration and the screening for multivariate metabolite signatures are affected by the choice of scale. To overcome this problem for metabolite signatures and to establish a scale-invariant biomarker discovery algorithm, we extended linear zerosum regression to the logistic regression framework and showed in two applications to 1H NMR-based metabolomics data how this approach overcomes the scaling problem. Logistic zero-sum regression is available as an R package as well as a high-performance computing implementation that can be downloaded at https://github.com/rehbergT/zeroSum.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to determine the reliability during a 2-year period of several newly developed iron-related assays to assess their potential for use in prospective epidemiologic studies. METHODS: We assessed the temporal reliability of several iron-related assays by using three serum samples collected at yearly intervals from 50 postmenopausal participants in a large prospective study. RESULTS: We observed high reliability coefficients for ferritin (0.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.67–0.86), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR; 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.69–0.87), sTfR/ferritin ratio (0.74; 95\% CI, 0.62–0.83), and hepcidin (0.89; 95\% CI, 0.84–0.94). In a subset of 30 women, lower reliability was observed for serum iron (0.50; 95\% CI, 0.29–0.70), unsaturated iron-binding capacity (0.55; 95\% CI, 0.34–0.73), total iron-binding capacity (0.60; 95\% CI, 0.40–0.76), and serum transferrin saturation rate (0.44; 95\% CI, 0.22–0.65). The reliability of anti-5-hydroxymethyl-20-deoxyuridine autoantibody titers, a biomarker of oxidized DNA damage, one of the mechanisms by which iron is thought to impact disease risk, was very high (0.97, 95\% CI, 0.5–0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that some newly developed iron-related assays could be useful tools to assess iron–disease associations in prospective cohorts that collect a single blood sample.

  abstract = {Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with multiple clinical outcomes, including osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis and colorectal cancer. In studies of vitamin D effect on disease outcome, vitamin D status is usually measured by a serum biomarker, namely 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D]. Since the circulating 25(OH)D concentration varies from season to season and not all blood samples are collected at the same time, the disease-vitamin D relationship can be obscured if the seasonal variation is not adjusted properly. In the literature, a two-step procedure is usually adopted, with the vitamin D level adjusted for the seasonal variation being obtained in the first step, and the effect of vitamin D being assessed based on the adjusted vitamin D level at the second step. This two-step method can generate misleading results as the estimation variance arising from the first step is not taken into account in the second step analysis. We consider three alternative procedures that unify the two steps into a single model. We conduct an extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of these methods and demonstrate their applications in a study of 25(OH)D effect on prostate cancer risk.},

  abstract = {Blood levels of iron and copper, even within their normal ranges, have been associated with a wide range of clinical outcomes. The available epidemiological evidence for these associations is often inconsistent and suffers from confounding and reverse causation. This study aims to examine the causal clinical effects of blood iron and copper with Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Genetic instruments for the blood levels of iron and copper were curated from existing genome-wide association studies. Candidate clinical outcomes were identified based on a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) between these genetic instruments and a wide range of phenotypes in 310,999 unrelated individuals of European ancestry from the UK Biobank. All signals passing stringent correction for multiple testing were followed by MR analyses, with replication in independent data sources where possible. We found that genetically predicted higher blood levels of iron and copper are both associated with lower risks of iron deficiency anemia (odds ratio (OR) = 0.75, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.67–0.85, p = 1.90 × 10−6 for iron; OR = 0.88, 95\% CI: 0.78–0.98, p = 0.032 for copper), lipid metabolism disorders, and its two subcategories, hyperlipidemia (OR = 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.85–0.96, p = 6.44 × 10−4; OR = 0.92, 95\% CI: 0.87–0.98, p = 5.51 × 10−3) and hypercholesterolemia (OR = 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.84–0.95, p = 5.34 × 10−4; OR = 0.93, 95\% CI: 0.89–0.99, p = 0.022). Consistently, they are also associated with lower blood levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Multiple sensitivity tests were applied to assess the presence of pleiotropy and the robustness of causal estimates. Regardless of the approaches, consistent evidence was obtained. Moreover, the unique clinical effects of each blood mineral were identified. Notably, genetically predicated higher blood iron is associated with an enhanced risk of varicose veins (OR = 1.28, 95\% CI: 1.15–1.42, p = 4.34 × 10−6), while blood copper is positively associated with the risk of osteoarthrosis (OR = 1.07, 95\% CI: 1.02–1.13, p = 0.010). Sex-stratified MR analysis further revealed some degree of sex differences in their clinical effects. Our comparative PheWAS-MR study of iron and copper comprehensively characterized their shared and unique clinical effects, highlighting their potential causal roles in hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia. Given the modifiable nature of blood mineral status and the potential for clinical intervention, these findings warrant further investigation.},

They are used e.g. in data mining or machine learning. Although they share the same goal, they reach it with different methods. Over the years, some misunderstandings came up, how these methods differ from each other. The result is, that sometimes if one talks about using the factor analysis, actually the principal component analysis was implemented. Or it is believed, that the factor analysis is an superset of the principal component analysis. These misconceptions could prevent practitioners to chose the appropriate tool for their intended use. This paper clarifies some misconceptions.},
